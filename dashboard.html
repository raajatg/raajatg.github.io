                        <p>Large organizations like Adidas often have common end-goals among employees, but can face significant challenges in delivering on those goals because the varying perspectives and skillsets of employees clash with, instead of complementing, one another.</p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">My Solution</span></h5>
                        <p>The “Impossible is Nothing” dashboard creates common ground and understanding between three key personas as they seek to improve the performance of Adidas’s fashion sneakers segment. It does so by identifying the key goals and commonalities that these personas have, and using those as an anchor point to provide a multi-variate lens on shoe performance and prototypes.</p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Outcomes</span></h5>
                        <p>We presented this final dashboard prototype to a group of panelists impersonating the three distinct personas - fashion designer, product manager, and global executive - and received unanimous praise for its ability to prioritize information and focus on salience and relevance over comprehensiveness. All three personas were able to extract the key information they needed from the dashboard, but were also able to better empathize with the needs and perspectives of their peers.</p>

                                <p>In this final design, users are first greeted with an overview page that presents a view of Adidas’ performance across three major dimensions – customer insights, social media trends, and financial performance. These three dimensions cater to the preferred method of assessing performance that a product manager (customer insights) fashion designer (social media trends) and a global executive would have. It provides a highly visual medium for these three stakeholders to easily digest relevant information for themselves, while also processing the information important to others.</p>

                                <p>The dashboard is meant to drive action with its insights. Users that make observations about what customers find desirable or what is trending on social media can then quickly translate those insights into their latest show prototypes on the production page. The production page offers an overview of all the latest shoe designs with metrics on the elements that matter most to all three stakeholders. Designers can easily determine the changes they need to make to the shoe, while executives and product managers can easily weigh in with the financial and customer data provided.</p>

                                <p>Designers can also zero in on a specific shoe to focus their attention. When switching to this view, the shoe slideshow gallery at the top left switches to a 360-degree view of the specific shoe they’re looking at. All graphs are updated to provide views of the specific shoe against peer comparables to make more context-driven decisions on the areas to improve. Designers can also see alternative shoe composition suggestions so they can easily identify how they can modify the shoe’s materials, and the resulting tradeoffs that will occur.</p>

                        <p><strong>Use Real Data: </strong>Within the scope of this project, the emphasis was on a thoughtfully designed dashboard that catered to the tastes of a diverse set of stakeholders. Although I tried to incorporate realistic data in the mockups, I would have wanted to see if the views were valuable and actionable to stakeholders when depicting real data.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do User Testing: </strong>This project provided our team with a set of three personas to build around, with the information about these personas predetermined. This forced us to make some assumptions about these stakeholders’ needs. I would have loved to test our mockups with actual shoe designers, product managers, and executives to see if our assumptions held water.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do More Competitor Research: </strong>Although we did spend time looking at best-in-class dashboards, most of them involved data visualizations in unrelated fields (e.g., wealth management). I would’ve been interested to study more production dashboards to glean any valuable ideas that we could adapt for our purposes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Stay Focused on User Needs: </strong>The only grounding data our team had for this project was the Adidas persona cards that we were asked to build our dashboard around. Although we did eventually course-correct, we had an initial tendency to make assumptions about these personas instead of diving into the information provided. Consequently, our initial dashboard views were far too generic and lacked focus.</p>
                        <p><strong>Wait Before Ramping Up Fidelity: </strong>Our team moved almost immediately from rough paper sketches to a detailed Figma prototype. We quickly realized that there were few benefits to doing so, as the higher visual fidelity was time-consuming to achieve, and by not taking the time to define a detailed vision, we faced a laundry list of issues in building the initial prototype.</p>
                        <p><strong>Design Modular Prototypes: </strong>In Figma, components are your friend. We learned that lesson too late in building our prototype as we neglected any sort of design system in our build and had major pains in adjusting our prototype as a result. By the end of our project, we had developed an entire design system formed from components, but we would have saved ourselves significant time by developing this system from the onset.</p>

                        <p><strong>Using Animations to Complement Content: </strong>Until this project, I had relied on Figma’s limited capabilities for animations and transitions. In building the dashboard, I delved into Protopie and gained a far more nuanced understanding of how animations can both draw the eye and prove distracting depending on their usage. By the project’s end, I was able to create compelling animations that emphasized the right content at the right time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Visualizing Complex Information: </strong>Coming from consulting, I had worked extensively with data to create informationally compelling visualizations, but this project helped me combine that expertise with a visual sense to create data visualizations that were both informative and visually delightful. These visualizations could please a fashion designer and a global executive!</p>
                        <p><strong>Prioritizing Information that Actually Matters: </strong>I firmly believe that the most important decisions in a dashboard involve deciding what information to <i>not</i> include, and this project gave me the comfort to make those decisions. It’s imperative to focus on the most salient user needs and constantly ask whether the information provided serves those needs and empowers users.</p>

                                The importance of diversity extends beyond inclusion and representation of ethnicities, genders, or sexualities. A less talked-about but equally critical part of any team’s success is their cognitive diversity, which enhances a company’s innovation by 20%, reduces risks by 30% and eases decisions’ implementation, according to Deloitte.
                                <br><br>
                                Despite the benefits, cognitive diversity can be elusive - it often involves instilling appreciation for varying perspectives, which can be difficult to do in siloed organizations where employees rarely explore the value of approaches beyond their bubble. To change that, our team designed a one-stop dashboard intended for three personas with three very different perspectives - Ansela, the Global VP for Adidas Fashion Sneakers, Kenny, the Director of Fashion Sneaker Marketing for North America, and SOS, a designer for Adidas Fashion Sneakers. 
                                <br><br>
                                Our dashboard creates a single view with which all three personas can get the information they need, and understand how other personas’ data directly impacts their own part of the shoe launch process.  We prioritize information with overlapping areas of interest to drive this understanding, so that these personas can effectively collaborate to design better shoes.

                                The very first step we took in building our dashboard was evaluating the current state of our model and identifying the most important common elements. What trends did we notice? Were there certain keywords that popped up time and again?
                                <br><br>
                                This meant honing in on consumer reviews and creating an affinity diagram in which we sorted trends into broader categories in a rose, bud, thorn format. A rose (pink sticky) indicated data to keep, a bud (green sticky) indicated data to modify, and a thorn (blue sticky) indicated data to add.
                                <br><br>

                                Common themes across our sketches were customizability and high level information. While we were discussing our sketches as a group, we noticed that many of the sketches had one thing in common: we had taken different types of information and placed them into organized categories on the dashboard in the form of “widgets”. 
                                <br><br>
                                However, from class dicussions, we found that our vision had elements that were too granular, such as numbers of followers on social media platforms. While we had high level information, each widget expanded to show further information. We stopped to question, “Can this information be easily found elsewhere?”
                                <br><br>
                                We decided to distill the vast variety of widgets we had from our individual sketches (over 25) into 16 - in our mind, this would provide a sufficient depth of information to all three stakeholders without being overwhelming.

                                In creating our first view of the dashboard, our goal was to be the single source of relevant information for all our stakeholders. We had identified the data elements that mattered to Sos, Kenny and Ansela through our Venn diagram and had identified compelling ways to present the data in the sketches, and so our purpose in constructing our first dashboard was to consolidate this information into a layout that was intuitive to navigate through. 
                                <br><br>
                                After consolidating our graphs into 16 relevant ones (each with deep-dives that provided more information), we began to see four categories emerge in the information they provided – Finance, Customer Needs, Web & Social Media, and Shoe Production. We decided to let those categories drive the layout of our dashboard, creating four pages that could be navigated between. Users could also click on a single graph to then get a more detailed view with multiple filtering option. 
                                <br><br>
                                We felt confident that we had been able to take the dashboard prompt provided to us and transform it into a hub of information that would provide all the information the stakeholders would need within two clicks at most.

                                After looking at our peers’ dashboards, we realized our dashboard had mistaken comprehensiveness for utility. In our attempt to address every potential user need, we had lost track of our stakeholders’ hypothesized rationale to use the dashboard. Ultimately, the role of a dashboard shouldn’t be to serve as a repository of data visualizations; instead its goal should be to provide relevant and actionable information that help users achieve a specific goal.
                                <br><br>
                                That all started with defining the central goal itself – we wanted to align on a goal that would unite the seemingly divergent interests of Ansela, Kenny and Sos to improve their collaborations and prevent siloed operations. We determined that goal was to design better sneakers. Following from that, all our dashboard information should provide actionable information to improve sneaker design. 
                                <br><br>
                                We revisited our dashboard with its visualization repository and conducted an Remove-Keep- Modify exercise, assessing whether each visualization furthered our stakeholders’ central goal in an actionable way in its current form, and whether modification would help. With this lens, we arrived at a significantly reduced and focused subset of graphs which complemented each other, rather than competing for attention.

                                We defined a central goal for our dashboard: to help the team design better shoes. The data had to be actionable and inform better design.
                                <br><br>
                                Subsequently, we went through the elements and decided to keep, alter or delete them based on our goal. As such, we changed the map to be global so Kenny could compare North America, the region he’s in charge of, to other Adidas regions. We got rid of data that could be easily found (motivated by Sara’s critqiue) and didn’t add value, such as Instagram followers. 
                                <br><br>
                                We also decided to be forward thinking by adding a page for prototype production. We switched from details on existing shoes to details on sneaker prototypes because exisiting shoes don’t change, rather Adidas releases newer and better versions. Therefore, understanding details on prototypes are much more actionable and relevant.

                                We found our dashboard still crowded, both from class and in group critique. We again went through each element, this time ideating a scenario for the personas to take action: “If Kenny sees Nike has the top hashtag, he can go on Twitter to learn more”; “If Sos sees a low sustainability score, she can draw inspiration from our alternative composition graphs.”
                                <br><br>
                                For essential data, we merged some graphs like ROI on the prototype page for the sake of readibility and visual finesse. We played with layout and added purple rectangles in the background to have clear visual and semantic groupings within our data.

                                We wanted to use motion for three key purposes - to invite the users of the dashboard to engage with it through a fun, engaging set of animations, to convey the “liveness” of information and how often it was being updated, and to ensure that information updates weren’t jarring to users (e.g., through sudden, immediate changes to the screen).
                                <br><br>
                                We elected to have loading animations for all the major elements of our dashboard, to invite our users to start using and engaging the dashboard (especially less data-inclined users like SOS).  We also were cognizant of the amount of data that we were displaying, and felt like these loading animations would provide time for the data to propagate in real life.

                                We wanted to make a conscious effort to have all data update “live” to maximize the dashboard’s relevance. We used animations to indicate how the data was changing (e.g., as new social media trends emerged, they “climbed” the graph, while out-of-date trends “fell” down. By doing this, we were able to use animation to both swap in new information, and communicate how that information was impacting what the users were seeing.

                                We closed off this project with a pitch presentation to a guest panel, which included actors playing the personas of Ansela, Kenny, and Sos. For our final pitch, we organized our presentation by starting and ending with an emphasis on the specific value our dashboard can bring to the company. Between the starting and ending, we made deep dives into the context of use, control, and dashboard elements. While walking through the elements of the dashboard, we made sure to emphasize how the personas would derive value from them, occasionally describing specific scenarios that Sos or Kenny might find themselves in. 
                                <br><br>
                                The pitch was received with overwhelming praise, with all personas seeming to find value from the dashboard, and commenting that it helped them build empathy for other perspectives that they would otherwise never have. We were able to achieve our goal of creating a single view that spoke to three distinct personas.

First, building around a focused goal is instrumental in delivering value because it ensures all information provided is genuinely useful. Second, motion is incredible—it can add character, communicate function, and turn awkward transitions beautiful. This fledgling designer has added another tool to his toolkit.
