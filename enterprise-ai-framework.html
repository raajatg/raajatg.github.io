                            I collaborated with the Line of Business leaders of one of Canada’s “Big 5” banks to develop an enterprise-wide methodology for prioritizing AI use cases that maximizes value to the bank’s customers, shareholders, and employees

                        <p>
                            One of Canada’s “Big 5” banks (referred to as “The Bank” for confidentiality reasons) had spent the last several years investing heavily in its foundational AI capabilities. The Bank was now looking to the future, and wanted to build a common perspective on evaluating the various potential use cases for AI across its lines of businesses going forward. Unfortunately, the bank’s scale had created several siloes and meant building an enterprise view of AI was no small feat. 
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Solution</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            The Enterprise AI Framework provides this common perspective, incorporating the input of over a dozen Bank stakeholders to provide a directional view of how much value any AI use case can expect to bring to The Bank. In combination with the Ethical AI Funnel, the framework prevent bottlenecks and drive alignments amongst employees by simplifying decision-making – prioritize use cases in the top right quadrant provided they abide by clear ethical considerations.

                        <p>
                            After our Enterprise AI Framework and Ethical AI Funnel were both approved for use by The Bank’s CEO and Global Review Council, The Bank was able to use our methodology to develop their “AI 100” – a list of 100 prioritized use cases, with 3 use cases going into production per quarter. Our work was also widely adopted and appreciated by all of The Bank’s Lines of Businesses (LOBs), a notoriously difficult feat to achieve given their clashing aspirations for The Bank’s future.

                                <p>
                                    This framework assesses AI use cases along three major factors. First – do they deliver clear financial impact to The Bank? Second – do they directly advance the goals of our clients and employees? Third – do they require minimal changes to internal systems and processes, and leverage mature technologies?
                                    <br><br>
                                    To arrive at these categories, we conducted interviews with LOB leaders to identify weaknesses within The Bank’s deployment capabilities and translated those to constraints that effective AI use cases needed to navigate. We also aligned with these leaders on what kind of value AI should deliver as part of The Bank, and these became goals for the use case to achieve.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Taken together, our constraints and goals formed the basis for our categories, and the framework itself.                                    
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The AI Use Case Prioritization Framework is based around optimizing for tradeoffs in an AI use case. Our team believes that no responsible organization will take this same “tradeoff mindset” when ensuring AI is deployed ethically – instead, any use case needs to meet minimum ethical standards before it can be deployed.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This thinking is reflected in the Ethical AI Funnel. Use cases must pass every condition in the funnel before they can be approved for assessment in the Prioritization Framework. Whereas the Prioritization Framework heavily incorporated stakeholder perspectives, the funnel only leverages the opinions of experts in ethical AI deployment to ensure we are getting qualified, unbiased perspectives.

                            <strong>Integrate the perspective of The Bank’s customers: </strong>
                            Ultimately, our focus was on collecting employee perspectives to build a common internal view of AI. However, given how client-centric our framework aimed to be, it would have been good to interview clients to understand how their needs could have factored into our framework                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Ensure the framework was properly implemented: </strong>
                            We were unable to oversee the implementation of our framework, because that went beyond the scope of our contract. I would have liked to check that our methodology was actually implemented in its delivered form, to learn from any potential mistakes                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Test the long-term viability of the framework:</strong>
                            We expected the frameworks to be living, breathing methodologies that adapted to The Bank’s circumstances, but I would have loved to be a part of those adaptations and adjust to the changing environment and challenges The Bank faced

                            <strong>Drive more internal collaboration: </strong>
                            The main driver for our hiccup at the project’s midway point was a result of developing The Bank’s AI vision and Enterprise AI Framework independently. I would have pushed for more collaboration between teams, to help us achieve a shared understanding of the client and their aspirations

                            As a result of aggressive project timelines, our team quickly transitioned from visioning exercises to solution development. I would have scoped out more time to generate ideas before driving towards a solution, to promote creativity and ensure we delivered the best possible solution

                            Several C-Suite members of The Bank participated, and often drove, alignment sessions. I would have pushed for more diversity in thinking – our most fruitful ideas came when everyone felt comfortable sharing their thoughts

                            <strong>Developing an implementation-ready novel concept: </strong>
                            I became far more comfortable at consolidating various secondary research and interview findings to find commonalities and structure them into a cohesive, value-additive framework that was ready for immediate implementation at The Bank

                            The Bank was used to a prescriptive approach, where they would provide us the information we needed and we would provide them a solution. I learned to show them the value in a collaborative, iterative approach, proving that it led to a stronger framework that everyone aligned on

                            To build the frameworks, I had to integrate perspectives across the bank, from Legal to Technology to Risk, and present a solution that they could all feel comfortable with. I learned to find commonalities in interests and goals, and use them to drive alignment

                                Within the last decade, AI has emerged as a clear focus area for business executives across the financial services industry due to its unmatched potential to drive scalable value. 
                                <br><br>
                                The Bank was no stranger to the importance AI would play in its future success and relevance within the Canadian banking industry. It had spent the last several years investing heavily into its foundational infrastructure and big data capabilities. It had even seen some early success with a number of AI projects generating ~$10M / year in revenue.
                                <br><br>
                                But The Bank was still struggling to scale its AI capabilities beyond this initial success, in large part because of its siloed operations. Although The Bank had invested money enterprise-wide to build foundational strengths, AI initiatives were being executed in pockets across The Bank’s various Lines of Business (LOBs). 
                                <br><br>
                                This had led to a fractured, inconsistent view of how AI should drive value going forward. It also meant that no single initiative could be deployed at scale because of disagreements between LOBs. The Bank’s current and future investments were at risk. 
                                <br><br>
                                Despite the issues caused by dissenting perspectives to date, our team felt these diverse perspectives and experiences could lead to a richer perspective if properly unified. How could we unify these perspectives to develop a single, powerful method for prioritizing AI use cases going forward?

                                When there are so many dissenting opinions about how to make a decision, how do you drive consensus? Our team believed it started with understanding how contrasting those opinions really were. I designed a semi-structured interview protocol that asked leaders of each of the LOBs a few overarching questions. 
                                <br><br>
                                We were focused on understanding how AI would enable their near- and long-term vision for The Bank, but we also wanted to know where The Bank was strong and weak in AI. With the first question, we could start to build towards a common future that we would enable with our framework. With our second question, we could think about prioritizing use cases that played to The Bank’s strengths. 
                                <br><br>
                                We conducted interviews with 15+ stakeholders across the LOBs. They consistently raised similar weaknesses – The Bank’s bias towards short-term returns on investment, scarcity in talent and usable data, and red tape that limited LOB collaboration and joint funding. We earmarked these points as potential constraints our framework would need to incorporate.
                                <br><br>
                                Unfortunately, there was little consensus on long-term vision. Each of our interviewees had a different view about how AI would shape the future of banking more broadly and that informed the role they thought AI should play in The Bank. Before we could move forward, we needed to create a shared vision of the future.

                                With so many different perspectives on how AI will impact the future of banking, our team wanted to curate those perspectives based off what was being validated by the market. To do so, we looked to industry leaders in AI, both within and outside of banking, to see what bets they were making on the future.
                                <br><br>
                                We mined secondary research sources and spoke with experts on the future of banking in financial services. Eventually, we arrived at 5 “archetypes” that each described a unique method that institutions were using AI to generate a competitive advantage. Between archetypes, each financial institution had different perspectives on how AI would shape the future of banking, and the role AI should play to generate value.
                                <br><br>
                                We saw many of these same perspectives surface from our interviews with The Bank’s stakeholders. It was impossible to hold all those perspectives and still create a cohesive vision for the future. However, these archetypes showed us which perspectives were compatible with one another, and how they guided a particular vision.
                                <br><br>
                                If we could understand which perspectives were more widely and deeply held, we could begin to shape a vision for The Bank’s future in the image of a market leader.

                                Our team wanted our stakeholders to align on a key set of beliefs about the future of AI in banking, and to align on the ramifications those beliefs would have on The Bank’s long-term vision.
                                <br><br>
                                To achieve our first goal, we scheduled an alignment session, with all relevant stakeholders together in a room. We presented the most commonly held beliefs from our interviews to everyone, then asked them to anonymously vote for their top three beliefs. After voting, we asked stakeholders to voice why they did or didn’t support rankings, repeating this process until we had consensus on rankings. 
                                <br><br>
                                With this anonymous approach, we created a safe space for people to voice their perspectives without feeling judged, while also allowing for healthy discussion. Once preconceptions about AI were broken down and people felt heard, alignment was quickly reached.
                                <br><br>
                                With a common view of the future of AI in banking, we presented stakeholders with the archetype that aligned with their views – Client-Centric. Where we would’ve had significant pushback at first, we now had total agreement. All our stakeholders agreed that The Bank should prioritize AI use cases that made it more client-centric. But how could we assess if a use case would do that?

                                Our stakeholders had aligned on how The Bank should use AI to drive value, and had also identified key strengths to leverage and weaknesses to avoid when deploying AI. How could we put all this information together to create a single view for prioritizing AI use cases?
                                <br><br>
                                I started by drawing out the constraints imposed by The Bank’s weaknesses. For a use case to succeed, what conditions needed to be true, based off what we had heard? This included factors like a quick ROI (or else funding for the project would stop). 
                                <br><br>
                                From there, I analyzed what conditions a use case needed to meet to be client-centric, as defined by the financial services archetype, Goldman Sachs. This included factors like relationship impact (deepening client relationships and building trust / loyalty). 
                                <br><br>
                                With these conditions and constraints fleshed out, I had nine discrete factors. I knew that The Bank needed a framework that was memorable and could be quickly used for prioritization. A list was the antithesis of these needs. 
                                <br><br>
                                To make it easier to digest, I sorted these factors by similarity, arriving at three distinct axes. To allow for visually digestible prioritization, I transformed these axes into a 3D matrix, with a X- and Y-axis and bubble size to express the three categories.

                                It was critical that this framework actually be usable and useful for stakeholders prioritizing use cases, so instead of getting their perspective on the framework in its abstract, we decided to see how users felt about it in context.

                                We developed an exercise where we developed sample AI-driven opportunities, then had our stakeholders collectively try to place these opportunities on the matrix. We conducted the session like a Think-Aloud Protocol, asking users to voice their thoughts on the framework’s pros and cons as they worked.
                                <br><br>
                                The exercise helped surface some major issues. Although we had aligned our framework to the findings of our interviews, we had failed to align it to The Bank’s overall enterprise strategy, which was built around driving purpose and impact for clients. The Bank was also focused on deploying mature technologies due to their risk profile, which we had also failed to incorporate.

                                More glaringly, we hadn’t considered the ethical implications of our framework. How would this framework help navigate legal regulations? How would it factor in bias? How explainable was the model?

                                Our team wanted to align the language of our framework to The Bank’s overarching vision. Although The Bank’s vision was publicly available, given how integrated it was across The Bank’s initiative, we wanted to understand what that vision meant to the internal employees of The Bank. What meaning had it taken on beyond its literal words?

                                We interviewed our LOB leaders again to get their take on what The Bank stood for. A few words continued to surface – purposeful, impactful, transparent, and coordinated. For our framework to be adopted, it needed to incorporate this language in its messaging.

                                We revisited our framework. Instead of focusing on purely commercial goals like financial viability or marketability, our stakeholders had repeatedly told us that AI needed to address core customer needs and meaningfully impact company profit. We adapted our language to better reflect these insights and the language used internally.

                                The purpose of our Enterprise AI Framework was to think about the tradeoffs involved in deploying AI. We understood that it may be hard to develop a use case that was financially impactful, purpose-driven, and easy to implement, and so our framework promoted use cases that was was the closest to being optimal.
                                <br><br>
                                However, we made the conscious decision to not include any ethical considerations in a tradeoff-based framework. In our view, ethical AI deployment was not something to neglect because other factors were attractive. It was table-stakes, and necessary for deployment. To reflect that, we developed a second framework – The Ethical AI Funnel. 
                                <br><br>
                                Before assessing a use case using the Enterprise AI Framework, users would have to take a use case through the funnel. Only if it matched every condition and “made it through” the funnel could it be assessed further. By doing this, we ensured that there were no compromises on deploying ethical AI.
                                <br><br>
                                We also consciously did not interview stakeholders when developing this funnel – this funnel required expertise in the area that our stakeholders didn’t have. Instead, we consulted with a series of ethical AI experts throughout North America, who understood Canada’s regulatory and commercial landscape. With their help, we arrived at our funnel elements, ordered by priority (Justification first, Accountability last).

                                We had developed our frameworks, but we were unsure if they would be readily adopted and used by The Bank’s employees upon delivery. Our stakeholders had no more availability before project-end, so we turned to a lo-fi interviewing method: email. We asked all our stakeholders a single question: What would stop you from using our frameworks in your roles?
                                <br><br>
                                Overwhelmingly, we received two pieces of feedback. First, stakeholders didn’t have enough use cases in the pipe to actually find value from the frameworks yet. Second, they didn’t know how to move from seeing the frameworks as theoretical constructs to engrained parts of the production process. 
                                <br><br>
                                In lieu of opportunities for more interviews, we leveraged our old interview insights to address both issues. For the first issue, we pored through all the use cases and ideas our stakeholders had mentioned in interviews. We consolidated them, and even tagged the ones we saw as “high-potential” to provide a starting point.
                                <br><br>
                                We also scraped our interviews for weaknesses in the bank’s ability to deploy AI. We prioritized them from most to least salient (based off mentions), added in thinking from our previous engagements on deploying AI, and were able to build a next steps timeline that made it clear how to embed our frameworks into The Bank.
                                <br><br>
                                We sent both documents out in emails, asking for quick feedback, and were met with resounding appreciation. Although we were asked to make some tweaks, both documents massively increased our stakeholders’ confidence that these frameworks would actually be used.

                                Our frameworks and next steps were presented to The Bank’s CEO and Global Review Council for approval and were received extremely well. Thanks to the perspectives of our stakeholders, our team was able to bring several LOB-level concerns to light with our frameworks that The Bank’s C-Suite was unaware of. They saw the frameworks as true enablers for the LOBs because they not only acknowledged LOB-level issues, they incorporated them into the decision-making process.
                                <br><br>
                                With leadership’s approval, The Bank was able to use our methodology to develop their “AI 100” – a list of 100 prioritized use cases, with 3 use cases going into production per quarter. Our work was also widely adopted and appreciated by all of The Bank’s Lines of Businesses (LOBs), a notoriously difficult feat to achieve given their clashing aspirations for The Bank’s future.

                                This was also my first time bringing an iterative, collaborative approach to a business environment. I saw how value-additive it was to integrate user perspectives and concerns into a solution, and how much more useful and usable that solution became because it addressed those perspectives. It was also heartwarming to see bank executives change their attitude to the approach, from hesitant to welcoming.
                                <br><br>
                                In my future client projects, I’ve made a focused effort to include my users and clients in the development process, and have seen significant upticks in solution buy-in and effectiveness. Although my perspective has evolved from being integrative to being human-centered, the principles I learned from this project are still core to my project management style.
