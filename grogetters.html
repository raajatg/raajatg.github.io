                        <p>
                            Despite the impact COVID-19 has had on commerce, some grocery stores have seen a <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/center-store/how-coronavirus-crisis-changing-grocery-shopping" target="_blank">30% increase in sales</a> as more people cook at home. With that said, customers have had to make significant concessions. <a href="https://themanifest.com/logistics/supply-chain/grocery-store-trends " target="_blank">Two-thirds of Americans prefer grocery shopping in-person</a>a, and yet don’t feel safe enough to do so and have resorted to online ordering. How can we reconcile this tension and make in-person grocery shopping safe again, when shopping needs are at an all-time high?
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Solution</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            GroGetters is a mobile and watch application that helps customers feel safe again as they navigate through the grocery store. The app leverages an AI algorithm to track an optimal path through the grocery store based off customers’ grocery list and minimize their time in-store. It also assists users in crossing items off their list, with location- and preference-based deal recommendations and live location tracking to remind users to collect forgotten items.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Outcomes</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            I tested our final design with households of varying sizes to capture their interest in our concept. Testers agreed that this app solved three of their critical needs at once. It minimized their cognitive load during a stressful experience by handling store navigation for them, it helped them save money with deals that they had given up on trying to track, and route optimization made them feel far safer by minimizing their exposure risk to COVID-19.

                                <p>
                                    Our app incorporates users list information, SKU data, and location data on the user and other app users to chart the optimal path through the store, minimizing total time in-store and avoiding larger congregations of shoppers. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    In keeping with users’ desire for a reduced cognitive load when they shop, our app supplements its traditional 2D navigation view with a 3D navigation view once users near their item. This 3D view allows users to pinpoint exactly where an item is on the shelf and offload all thinking to the app’s navigation.                                    
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Our users noted how often they had meticulously made a grocery list before going to the store, then realized they had completely forgotten a critical item once in-store. Our app accounts for this common issue, by allowing users to easily view, update, and modify their lists based off their latest needs.
                                    <br><br>
                                    With several of our users expressing discomfort with frequently touching their devices for fear of COVID contamination, we also support multi-modal list entries – traditional keyboard search on mobile, and voice search on watch.                                    
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Another common source of stress involved narrowing down vague list jot-downs to specific purchases. Users that wrote down “bread” would approach an aisle, see 7 different brands, and be struck with indecision. Pressure to decide quickly would often lead to suboptimal choices.
                                    <br><br>
                                    GroGetters features a discovery tool to help. Once users near an item of interest, they can quickly scan through recommended brands for them based off their previous purchases and in-store deals they can capitalize on. On watch, this view dynamically updates based off the nearest product.                                    
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Forgotten Item Prevention</span></h5>
                                <p>
                                    Unfortunately, this pressure to quickly move from item to item resulted in another major source of frustration – forgotten items. Users often lost track of items on their list and moved to checkout either forgetting about an item entirely, or mistakenly thinking they had gotten it.
                                    <br><br>
                                    GroGetters uses location data to track if users paused at a listed item or walked past it. For users that don’t pause, the app triggers a quick haptic and modal notification to remind users to go back. For users that have just changed their mind, they can easily dismiss the notification.

                            <strong>Flesh out the edge cases more: </strong>
                            Our designs worked well within the tight problem definitions we crafted, but sometimes broke down with added complexity (e.g., how does the 3D map work when there are multiple items on the same shelf?). I’d love to better identify and address these issues.

                            <strong>Prototype our solution within the context of use: </strong>
                            Our testing all took place with virtual run-throughs of our screens. I think we could learn a lot more with a higher-fidelity prototype that users could test in the context of shopping, allowing us to map specific unseen challenges.

                            <strong>Designing for multiple platforms: </strong>
                            I’ve focused most of my design work to date on traditional interfaces (e.g., web, mobile), and so learning how to translate information-rich mobile screens to a constrained watch interface was challenging and illuminative.

                            <strong>Creating more delightful interactions: </strong>
                            With such a strong focus on creating a frictionless, stress-free user experience, I developed a deep understanding of various interaction design patterns and how to effectively use them to design intuitive and delightful experiences.

                                Customers rely on grocery shopping now more than ever. <a href="https://themanifest.com/logistics/supply-chain/grocery-store-trends" target="_blank">38% of people are spending more money on grocery shopping than they did before COVID-19</a>. Despite the decreased risk of exposure to COVID-19 that comes from online ordering or pickup, that uptick in grocery shopping has translated to a significant increase in in-store purchases. <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/consumer-trends/grocery-basket-size-store-trips-down-6-months-pandemic" target="_blank">Two-third of American shoppers</a> still prefer to make purchases in-store.
                                <br><br>
                                Instead of changing where they shop, customers are changing how they shop. The <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/consumer-trends/grocery-basket-size-store-trips-down-6-months-pandemic" target="_blank">average grocery bill has risen dramatically</a> during COVID as customers reduce the frequency with which they go outside, and instead make the most out of each trip with longer lists and longer trips. 
                                <br><br>
                                This has put significant stress on shoppers. Fear of catching COVID-19 is forcing users to minimize time in-store. Increased reliance on grocery shopping and WFH flexibility has made it difficult to find low-traffic time slots. With increased basket sizes and list sizes to boot, the shopping experience feels compressed, unsafe, and complex. How can we help shoppers get what they need while reducing their stress levels?

                                Our initial research raised as many questions as it answered. Although we understood that in-store grocery shopping was still dominant, and we knew that the experience was stressful, we were still confused. Why would users continue to shop in-store given how stressful it was? What made the experience stressful? Where were the opportunities for innovation?
                                <br><br>
                                We designed a contextual inquiry protocol to uncover the answers, asking users to recount the end-to-end process of their best and worst grocery shopping experiences during COVID-19. With this method, users were able to relive their experiences and all its nuances, providing us with a rich set of rationale and painpoints.
                                <br><br>
                                We interviewed 13 people aged 21-70 across America, understanding that grocery shopping was an experience that extended across demographics. To collect our thinking, we developed individual customer journey maps for each of our interviews to chart out the touchpoints, emotions, painpoints and opportunities for each user. We then consolidated our 13 maps into a single one which highlighted the most salient elements of our interview. This approach allowed us to remain focused on the user experience throughout our research process.

                                With a single consolidated customer journey map and a deep understanding of painpoints and satisfaction at each stage in the shopping process, we were able to build a nuanced view of our target user.
                                <br><br>
                                They hated going in-store because of the stress that came with COVID-19 exposure risks. They also hated the length and complexity of shopping trips as they shopped for two weeks of food for an entire household. Despite this, they still preferred in-person shopping because of increased agency and control over what they bought. 
                                <br><br>
                                We also uncovered that the in-store shopping experience was the most painful part of the shopping experience based off number of painpoints and average emotional state. Three major issues emerged:
                                <ol>
                                <li>Users consistently complained about how long it took to maneuver through the store with lengthy, constantly changing lists</li>
                                <li>The stress from avoiding potential carriers of COVID made it difficult to focus on their grocery needs and resulted in mistakes and forgetting items</li>
                                <li>With shoppers prioritizing convenience, they were also unable to capitalize on sales and coupons like before, making them feel like they were wasting money</li>
                                </ol>
                                With these issues in mind, we were able to narrow our focus – we needed to <i>help shoppers improve their in-store shopping experience by reducing their time in-store, reducing their cognitive load, and helping them save money</i>. To focus our efforts moving forward, we developed a persona of our target user and their various needs.

                                With our analysis completed, we knew our solution needed to have three core features:
                                <ol>
                                <li>Minimize customers’ time in-store</li>

                                </ol>
                                To foster creativity in thinking, we each spent time creating and sketching out a potential solution to our issue before comparing our ideas. In thinking through my idea, I thought about a frustration that users kept returning to when discussing their time in-store: navigation. With long lists and reduced cognitive loads, people didn’t know where to go for items, creating frustration and confusion.
                                <br><br>
                                I developed a mockup of a navigation-style app. Users could input their needed items, and the app would trace an optimal path through the store to get each item. Users could add / remove items to their list quickly, and determine which brand they wanted based off in-store deals. 
                                <br><br> 
                                After comparing our ideas, the team decided to further develop my mockup. It served to minimize time in-store, helped users manage their list while presenting only the relevant item at any given time, and presented relevant sales at the point of selection. But how could we test the viability of this idea?

                                We developed a low-fidelity mockup of our solution, in which shoppers selected a store and list, then were provided with an optimized navigation route through the store. They could click an icon to access their list and add to it, or click an item on the map to see deals. 
                                <br><br>
                                We then got feedback on this flow from fellow designers, who had the added advantage of also being in-store grocery shoppers. They noted that the flow of our app was unintuitive. Users didn’t know how to select a list. It was unclear whether the app was providing directions to follow now or later. The app required users to click to change map views and constantly switch between different screens to view the list or deals. <a href="https://media0.giphy.com/media/9MJ6xrgVR9aEwF8zCJ/giphy.gif" target="_blank">In short – our navigation app was unintuitive to navigate.</a>

                                Half of our testers also commented that they were uncomfortable using a mobile app because they wanted to reduce physical contact with their mobile device when outdoors. They preferred something that could provide the information they needed while remaining low-touch.

                                Our testing had revealed that user needs were distinctly different before and after they went into the grocery store. Before going in-store, they wanted to make sure they were prepared for their trip, and exercised extreme diligence. Once in-store, they prioritized efficiency, minimal cognitive load, and quick decision-making.
                                <br><br>
                                In our second iteration of the mobile design, I accommodated these two identities. Before entering the store, I took users through a set of confirmation screens to double-check their store location and list selection. This confirmation helped users feel prepared before their trip began.

                                Once in store, I revamped the design of the app to focus on the navigation screens, with quick access to relevant information. On the main screen, users received all navigation information at a glance – their current step, next step, items in aisle, and total trip time. 
                                <br><br>
                                To minimize cognitive load, deals were context-specific. Users could access them by clicking on a nearby item on the map to only see deals for that item. The list was a separate page to preserve distinctness from navigation, but it was combined with the search feature to easily add and remove list items. With this new flow, users only had to interact with two screens and a modal across their entire in-store experience.                                
                            </p>

                                However, this revamped mobile flow still didn’t account for our significant user set that had sworn off a mobile app altogether. How could we improve their in-store shopping experience while minimizing their interaction with their devices?
                                <br><br>
                                Smart watches offered a potential solution. Watches are designed for “hands-free” experiences, incorporating multi-modal forms of feedback (e.g., haptic, voice) to interact with users while still conveying information effectively. We decided to leverage the watch interface as a complementary tool to our mobile app for select users.
                                <br><br>
                                Since I had designed the mobile screens, I helped the team think through how to translate the mobile experience to watch. Chief in my considerations was information prioritization. With limited screen real estate, we needed to only provide the most salient information to users to reduce their cognitive load and time in-store.
                                <br><br>
                                We elected to have three screens that users could toggle between once they confirmed their list – the main navigation screen (only showing current directions), a deals screen updated for the nearest item, and a list screen that users could add items through via voice search. This simplified view limited user interactions and contact, while still accomplishing our overarching goals.

                                        When we design for watch, we have at most a quarter of the screen real estate. We can’t try to display 100% of the information that we do on mobile. We need to really think about what information is needed when navigating the store, and provide that. If we don’t prioritize, then our watch is just an inefficient piecemeal mobile app

                                We once again presented our prototypes to other designers for feedback, this time in the form of a think-aloud protocol, where users interacted with our apps and provided their thoughts.
                                <br><br>
                                Users responded extremely positively to the majority of our changes, but had continued criticism. On the mobile interface, users were confused by our inconsistent design choices – why was the deals section a modal, but the list section a separate page? They preferred a single page for all features. Their confusion was exacerbated by styling choices that heavily used bold and large fonts, and split user focus.
                                <br><br>
                                They also thought our micro-interactions undermined the quick navigation of the app. Each selection required a double-tap (once to select, once to confirm), which was both unintuitive and slow.

                                Across watch and mobile, users also wanted more help in actual navigation. They noted that getting to an item’s location was only half the battle – they also needed to know where it was on a shelf. They also described how they would likely miss items that were close by, and that the app didn’t help prevent this.

                                    Our mobile app needed to be even more streamlined to satisfy users’ goals – this came down to a consistent, single-page view that incorporated directions, deals, and lists along with a more seamless set of micro-interactions

                                The final mobile flow incorporated user feedback to feature all relevant shopping information on a single page once users entered the store. Users’ lists, deals, and search features are all included as modals on the main navigation screen. 
                                <br><br>
                                This separation of features makes it easy for users to perform the exact task they need, while the modal design makes it easy to view directions in the background or return to the larger navigation screen.
                                <br><br>
                                I also overhauled the visual finish of the app, playing with color and typography to create clear focal points on each screen. Darker and bolder elements display key information, while lighter elements provide supplementary details.
                                <br><br>
                                To aid in item selection, I also incorporated a “Forgotten Item” feature which triggers when users move quickly past an item to remind them to go back and collect it. However, because users expressed extreme discomfort with their phone actually touching an item, I choicefully did not add a more detailed “shelf-level” navigation, allowing users to put their phone away before collecting an item.

                                In updating our micro-interactions, I realized how many of our users had tried to “swipe” on the items in order to add them to cart before realizing the micro-interaction was click-based. These users were clearly leaning on established design patterns to guess how to act. I decided to lean into this design pattern.
                                <br><br>
                                I replaced all the double-tap micro-interactions with a simple, swipe-based micro-interaction – swipe left to add an item, and swipe right to remove it. Beyond being intuitive, this also allowed for users to preview their action (at the beginning of their swipe) and confirm it (by swiping through) all in one smooth action, expediting the process.

                                For reminders on items users may have forgotten, I instead added in a haptic feedback response. This ensured that users would receive a signal even if their phone was pocketed and they were not using the app diligently, which would be likelier for users that forgot items.

                            Although I did not lead the development of the watch interface, I did contribute to the thinking on several design choices, as we worked to create a design that was harmonious on mobile and watch.
                            <br><br>
                            We elected to include a 3D map view on watch to accommodate users. Although this 3D view clashed with users’ need to be hands-free when getting an item off the shelf, it was actually complementary to that need if provided on watch. Users could easily refer to their watch for item placement, then use both hands to get the item without it “contaminating” their device.
                            <br><br>
                            The watch also prioritized hands-free methods of interaction, including voice search for item search, haptic feedback to remind users about forgotten items, and hand-shaking to open up the deals section. We wanted to incorporate users’ need to access critical features without touching their device, and these three elements were the most important features of the app outside of navigation (which was on the home page).

                                As a final assessment of our project, I tested our high-fidelity screens as part of a think-aloud protocol with a sample set of 3 of our original interviewees. They ran through the screens while imagining that they were entering a grocery store to conduct their shopping, then shared their thoughts as they used the app.
                                <br><br>
                                Reactions were universally positive. Interviewees noted how the app was like “the perfect assistant” and provided the exact information they needed to know in the moment, while also allowing them to add their input where they wanted. They also praised the watch interface for accommodating their fear of COVID spread, and loved its multi-modal interaction techniques. All three users indicated that they would use the app if it was developed.
                                <br><br>
                                I also became far more adept at designing for multiple platforms. It was initially a challenge to translate a mobile-first application to watch, but I learned how to prioritize information for translation to watch, and also learned to embrace the affordances of watch (e.g., multi-modal interactions, hands-free capabilities) that mobile didn’t have. I realized that designing for multiple platforms isn’t about replicating an experience – it’s about delivering the same value proposition while accounting for each interface’s context of use and capabilities.
