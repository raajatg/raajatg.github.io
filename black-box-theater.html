                            I developed the concept of a subscription-based box for the patrons of Pittsburgh’s <a href="https://kelly-strayhorn.org/" target="_blank">Kelly Strayhorn Theater</a>. The box packs all the ingredients of a memorable “night out” for friends to enjoy together in their individual homes, and turns isolated virtual performances into social events once again.

                            <a href="https://kelly-strayhorn.org/" target="_blank">The Kelly Strayhorn Theater</a> (KST) has faced issues with financial and operational viability in the wake of COVID-19, as they have been forced to close the theater down and move their content over to the hyper-competitive world of online media. KST’s recipe for success before COVID-19 has been to foster a tight-knit community that was loyal to the theater and its content. But is this even possible anymore?
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Solution</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            Instead of competing against their peers on content, Black Box Theater instead supplements online content with a holistic experience, where subscribers can enjoy pre-performance cocktails, in-performance snacks and games, and post-performance discussion with friends, all from the comfort of their couch. The event box once again puts focus on the theater’s community and facilitation of social connection as a means of differentiation, all in accordance with COVID-19 safety measures.

                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Outcomes</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            We presented our research findings and initial low-fi mockups of our solution to various members of KST. The box was widely lauded as tying back to KST’s core mission – acting as a conduit for building strong relationships within the Pittsburgh community. KST’s team loved that the box existed outside of people’s screens and tackled screen fatigue, which contrasted favorably against several of their competitors’ technology-heavy solutions. They also found our solution’s operational feasibility to be a major differentiator for them, given KST’s financial concerns during the pandemic.

                                    Black Box Theater is meant to be part of a fun night in on the weekend. Given just how prominent social media is during people’s leisure time (especially during the pandemic), and with KST having a strong Instagram presence, we decided to introduce the solution on KST’s Instagram page. Targeted Instagram marketing has also already proven effective for KST in reaching new, interested audiences without a physical presence. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    For users that click on the ad, they are taken through a simple flow where they learn more about what Black Box Theater is and select preferred box items that are customized for the show that interests them most. We also incentivize group purchases with group discount codes.

                                    Users will soon be greeted by the distinctive black box - simple on the outside, but festive and colorful on the inside. Our interviewees were concerned about having a loud, eye-catching box delivered to their doorstep for fear of thievery, but also wanted the unboxing experience to be exciting. This design balances these seemingly contradictory preferences. The box’s unique design also makes it a souvenir of its own, something that our users loved the idea of.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The artifacts of the box are all contained within a smaller box that users can take with them to their sofa, simulating the snack box of a theater both for added convenience and to add to the “night out” experience.
                                    
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Inside the box, the artifacts are designed to transport theatergoers back to what made theater enjoyable before COVID by providing all the means to enjoy the trappings that surround theater – food, drinks, games, and memorabilia. The box is filled with snacks and desserts to enjoy during the show, cocktail recipe cards and ingredients to use in a pre-performance drink-making activity, playbills that hearken back to the days when shows came with souvenirs, and trivia cards to use as a part of intermission games (only designed artifacts depicted). 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Friends can easily coordinate to watch the same show together, and enjoy the various activities accompanying the show as a group despite being physically distant, bringing the “night out” experience to their living rooms.

                        <p><strong>Test our Idea with Patrons of Kelly Strayhorn Theater: </strong>Our final idea was received relatively positively by the participants we interviewed (theatergoers across the USA and Canada). However, we were unable to interview actual patrons of the Kelly Strayhorn Theater to identify if there were any specific factors that would limit the Black Box Theater’s effectiveness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Identify the Business Viability of the Idea: </strong>One of the major pieces of criticism our solution received from members of KST was that it may be outside the budget constraints of the theater, and so would be difficult to implement. I’d want to learn more about the theater’s budgetary constraints, and how this solution could abide by them while still delivering a strong experience.</p>
                        <p><strong>Increase Solution Fidelity:  </strong>We focused our efforts on understanding the core components of a desirable solution for theatergoers. To that end, our prototypes are still relatively low-fidelity and communicate the content and breadth of the solution more than its final visual aesthetics. I’d love to spend time increasing all five elements of the solution’s fidelity <a href= "https://modus.medium.com/prototype-fidelity-its-more-than-high-and-low-4dedb4cb1a0" target= “_blank”>(visual, interaction, breadth, depth, content) </a>, accompanied with continued user testing.</p>

                        <p><strong>Be More Mindful of Environmental Constraints: </strong>We spent a lot of time thinking about and testing ideas that weren’t very feasible (e.g., expensive content or merchandise) or that didn’t pay enough attention to COVID-related risks (e.g., community meetups to watch performances). In future endeavors, I’d limit myself to exploring a smaller set of feasible ideas in more depth.</p>
                        <p><strong>Interview More Representative Users: </strong>Despite KST’s focusing on dance-based performances, issues in availability meant our team primarily interviewed fans of traditional theater (i.e., plays). Although there was significant overlap in interests, many of our insights were geared towards elements that more feasible for plays than dance (e.g., interactive performances, co-creation of scripts). I would focus more attention on finding fans of KST’s specific form of art.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prepare More Rigorously for Interviews: </strong>I took for granted just how difficult it can be to effectively conduct user interviews. Considering how much the insights of any UX research project depend on effective interviews, I would prepare far more by developing a list of potential follow-up questions and being more mindful of leading questions that biased some of the users we interviewed for this project.</p>

                        <p><strong>Reinforcing Insights with Insights: </strong>One particularly powerful method that our team made consistent use of was the “Walk the Wall” method, in which we would reflect on all our learnings to date to inspire our future ideation sessions. The method stuck with me, and I encouraged the team to constantly explore how our past insights and connections could guide our future insights and areas of exploration. Our constant referencing of the past was a huge part of why our eventual solution felt so ironclad, as it had been continually reinforced throughout the project.</p>
                        <p><strong>Applying User Research Methods: </strong>I had never conducted the majority of the user research methods taught in the class, but by the end of the project, I felt confident in understanding when and how to apply each of the many user research methods. In particular, I felt that my interviewing abilities drastically improved by the project’s end.</p>
                        <p><strong>Defining Effective Solutions with Limited Technology Reliance: </strong>Given KST’s budget constraints, technologically complex solutions were either impractical or unwanted, and so I learned how to create user value without leaping to a technology-driven solution. The project helped me learn how to develop solutions that were <a href="http://nakedinnovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/NakedInnovation_Chapter02.pdf" target="_blank">desirable, feasible and viable</a> and broaden my comfort zone.</p>

                                Enjoying a night out at the theater has always been about more than the show. For so many patrons, a night out has meant using the theater as a backdrop to enjoy fun times with friends, and deepen relationships through shared relationships. Due to COVID-19 and the push to online formats, local theater has lost much of that community-building element, and instead has struggled to remain relevant in the saturated market of online content delivery.
                                <br><br>
                                Pittsburgh’s Kelly Strayhorn Theater (KST) has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19. KST was already struggling with attendance and donations prior to 2020 because of its location in a historically impoverished neighbourhood, and its vocal support of Black and LGBTQ+ organizations. COVID-19 has only exacerbated issues by nixing traditional live performances and KST’s extensive community growth initiatives which helped it build a loyal following in the first place.
                                <br><br>
                                Now, KST hopes to course-correct and understand how they can continue their mission of bringing communities together with pandemic-compliant initiatives. In doing so, they have three main goals which our team was asked to address:

                                    <li>How might we transform the physical theater experience into a shared online experience? </li>
                                </ul>

                                KST’s initial prompt was too broad for us to formulate a single problem statement around. To determine the most salient issue for our team to address, we first needed to understand the broader context KST was operating in. What challenges was the theater industry facing more broadly, both as a response to COVID and due to more systemic issues? How had theatergoers’ preferences changed in 2020? What offerings were tablestakes for organizations to succeed in this new environment?
                                <br><br>
                                Our team conducted extensive secondary research to answer these questions. One thing was clear – theater companies had no consensus on how to adapt. Across all of America, theater had been “democratized”  - it could no longer hold a monopoly on content for a specific region and rest on those laurels. 
                                <br><br>
                                Theater companies had to compete against one another, and the millions of titles that streaming giants were constantly releasing. Audiences called out that theater’s entertainment value came from creating connections between performance members and audience members. Now that theater wasn’t live, it felt less special.
                                <br><br>
                                For KST to succeed, it looked like they would have to focus on rebuilding intimate audience connection, either through more engaging content or creating experiences beyond the content. But how well were they positioned to do that?

                                        One major aspect of theater attendance that becomes crucial to feeling present at the theater is the feeling of communitas with other audience members. From the Oxford Dictionary of Cultural Anthropology, communitas refers to “[t]he heightened sense of social cohesion and solidarity experienced by individuals during liminal phases in rites of passage and pilgrimage.” It creates a feeling of belonging to the group a heightened sense of community and belonging.

                                Our secondary research had helped us understand some broad opportunity spaces to pursue further, but we felt it was equally important to investigate avenues that were also feasible for KST. Our ideal problem statement should address an area that was both desirable for KST’s patrons and viable for the business. 
                                <br><br>
                                To understand KST’s position in the industry, we looked to understand what factors had made the theater successful in the past, and if any of those factors could be promising opportunities to investigate further. 
                                <br><br>
                                We took a look at KST’s sales data in 2018, 2019, and 2020 and examined patron survey data across that span using Tableau. We realized that KST had struggled with attendance for years, and that many of their audience members had called out the type of content the theater presented as a reason. They wanted more interactive content (classes and workshops were significantly more well-received than traditional performances) because they felt more fulfilling and entertaining.
                                <br><br>
                                We also saw the power of community in KST’s reach. 55% of first-time attendees and 44% of total attendees attended a show because of word of mouth. Word of mouth had completely died down as a result of COVID and the death of event-based content, which had significantly dampened the reachability of KST’s events in turn. How could we revitalize this critical marketing tool?

                                To help wrap our head around all this new information we were receiving, our team decided to reframe how we were looking at the problem and face our own biases in how we were narrowly defining potential opportunity spaces. To do so, we engaged in a <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-challenge-assumptions" target="_blank">“reverse assumptions”</a> exercise. 
                                <br><br>
                                We started by stating KST’s three problem statements. We then listed out all the assumptions we had on how to address those problems (e.g., successful shows require large turnouts). For each assumption, we used our research to date to inform viable solutions that reversed those assumptions (e.g., successful shows don’t need large turnouts. They would be successful if all audience members felt connected to one another). 
                                <br><br>
                                We realized that until now, we had thought that good content and large turnouts would help address KST’s three issues. Our evidence had shown the opposite – good theater could be something that focused on building connections between viewers, and focused on smaller, intimate groups to strengthen those connections. 
                                <br><br>
                                From these insights, we formed our initial problem statement - <i>How might we improve KST’s audience-to-audience engagement in a virtual environment?</i> We would focus less on developing riveting content, and more on identifying ways to facilitate connections between audience members themselves. But how could we confirm whether this problem statement was genuinely valuable for KST to explore?

                                Our team had taken a stance based off our initial research – audiences cared about connecting with other audience members. But how could we test if this was true? We needed to find a way to motivate our users to thoughtfully evaluate this hypothesis in context so we could iterate on it before progressing further.
                                <br><br>
                                To do this, we turned to Think Aloud Protocols for generative research. Since we had no prototypes to test in context, we instead thought that if we could get our users to use a competitor’s offering that had tools for audience-to-audience engagement, then they could more accurately reflect on whether this was a factor that mattered to them. This protocol could also yield useful insights on additional factors that mattered to users and inform our future research.

                                We struggled to identify a theater company that effectively facilitated audience-to-audience engagement. We pivoted and began looking at content providers in other spaces that excelled in driving audience-to-audience engagement around content, examining, eventually settling on Twitch.tv.

                                The Twitch community is among the internet’s most dedicated, thanks to a number of novel elements like unique chat features, the ability to easily donate and get live feedback from performers, and the “always-live” content that Twitch has to create stronger audience-performer connections. We built a protocol that had avid theatergoers walk through some of Twitch’s novel audience engagement features, including content discovery, chat features, and donation tools, then discuss their thoughts about those features.

Although they offered audience-to-audience and even audience-to-performer engagement, users noted that what they really wanted was a more intimate connection with people. Messages “into the void” didn’t fulfil this desire. They also felt ostracized from the Twitch in-group, further limiting their enjoyment with the chat options.

                                Users also hated how transactional the viewer-performer relationship was on Twitch. Twitch streamers would often ask for donations or subscriptions in exchange for content, but our users wanted to get more insight into performers’ lives and how they planned to use donations. They wanted to attend behind-the-scenes and Q&A programs to get to know performers. They didn’t just want to engage with other audience members – they wanted to engage with the entire community, including performers.

                                The interviews helped us realize our problem statement was far too narrow. Users didn’t just want more engagement – that was too shallow. They didn’t want to connect only with other audience members – they wanted to connect with the entire theater community. We decided to revise our problem statement to encompass these insights.

                                Although we had done enough research at this point to align on a strong problem statement, our team still felt lost when it came to identifying a robust solution. We knew that we needed to create a sense of community for theatergoers in a virtual environment, but how?
                                <br><br>
                                We wanted our target audience – Americans with intimate ties to the performing arts – to reflect on their relationship with theater. We also understood that just asking them about their relationship with theater before COVID would run into unreliable narrator syndrome – they would neglect important details and gloss over contextual details.
                                <br><br>
                                To address these issues, we leveraged the contextual inquiry method. We asked avid theatergoers to bring two artifacts to the interview – one representing their sense of community with performing arts, and one reminding them of their favorite performance. By anchoring our questions around what these artifacts meant to interviewees, we could transport back in time to when they received those artifacts, and explore the relationships and contexts that created a sense of community. 
                                <br><br>
                                The approach yielded significant success, as we were able to drive on the specific moments that caused theatergoers to eventually save their artifact, and the reasons why they still remember that experience fondly.

                                To translate our interview notes into actual insights, we discussed each interview in length and noted specific insights we extracted in an Excel file. Once we had a list of ~100 insights (~20 per interview), we put all those insights onto a single Figma board and built an affinity diagram to better understand what the underlying commonalities were between interviewees’ preferences and needs.
                                <br><br>
                                We were able to gather a few significant insights. Theater is an inherently social activity, something that people want to experience together. Theater is also a means to strengthen existing connections with friends and family – people didn’t want to meet up with or build relationships with strangers, especially at a time when socializing of any kind was at a premium. 
                                <br><br>
                                Good theater was also something that challenged and provided learning opportunities. People relished the opportunity to discuss their thoughts about a show afterwards, and to learn new perspectives from those discussions. These discussions helped them grow as a person, and was a critical part of theater that was missing.
                                <br><br>
                                At the same time, good theater was immersive. It allowed people to escape from their everyday lives and soak in good memories with friends, without the distractions of other activities. How could we bring these three elements to a virtual environment?

                                    Although theatergoers want to use theater as a means of facilitating social connection, they wanted to focus on deepening connections with friends and family. Socializing with strangers was mentally exhausting and felt more like a chore than a perk

                                At this stage, our team felt confident about the depth of insights we had. We wanted to progress to translating those insights into solutions. To get our thoughts flowing, we engaged in a <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch/crazy-8s" target="_blank">“Crazy Eights”</a> exercise, in which we brainstormed 8 completely random, different ideas within 8 minutes – one minute per idea. These ideas likely wouldn’t be winners, but they’d help us communicate the areas we wanted to focus on with our solutions, and help us externalize our thinking.
                                <br><br>
                                After sketching out 32 ideas, we decided to group them by common painpoints to identify areas of interest across our entire team. Four areas in particular jumped out to us: (1) Theater needs to provide an opportunity for meaningful interpersonal connection; (2) Theater needs to be part of a larger, extraordinary event to create memorable social experiences; (3) Theater should provide a two-way connection between the performer and audience; and (4) Theater should provide tangible artifacts that theatergoers can share with others.
                                <br><br>
                                We decided to each take charge of fleshing out three distinct, well-developed ideas for those buckets in the form of storyboards. Storyboards are an easy, quick, efficient way of communicating an idea to others without needing to build anything. They can help test if users’ needs are aligned with our impression of users’ needs. 
                                <br><br>
                                To test whether these ideas were worth pursuing, and how extreme of a solution users were interested in, we each developed three versions of our bucket – one that was extremely normal and believable, one that was a bit extreme, and one that completely ignored social norms or assumptions about what a good solution looked like.

                                We now had 12 storyboards. We tested each of them with a group of users to understand where users converged and diverged in their interests. These storyboards also helped us understand how users’ stated preferences differed from their actual preferences – many users claimed that an idea was interesting to them during contextual inquiries, but speed dating made these ideas real and forced users to confront potential drawbacks. We learned three main things.
                                <br><br>
                                First – users only wanted to share the theater experience with their friends, and only when it didn’t interrupt consumption of the performance. Users repeatedly showed discomfort with interacting outside their friend group (even with performers), but also liked interaction in general to be contained to before and after performances so as to not distract from the performance itself.
                                <br><br>
                                Second – users loved multi-sensory experiences that extended beyond the screen. They expressed screen fatigue, and wanting to enjoy novel activities with their friends that challenged them and strengthened friendships. 
                                <br><br>
                                Third – users enjoyed interactive content, but only when it could be engaged with passively. If they could play games or vote for selections without any pressure, they were at their happiest. Being put on the spot through discussions or involved activities was thoroughly unenjoyable.
                                <br><br>
                                These findings helped us solidify our focus on creating a holistic experience. Although the performance itself was central to this, we needed to find a way to immerse audiences in social experiences that extended beyond the show they were watching.

                                With our fresh set of insights, we brainstormed a new set of eight ideas that reflected the newly surfaced user preferences. We came up with a wide range of ideas, including a virtual theater lobby where people could mingle with one another, a “golden ticket” idea where select theatergoers would win free dance lessons, and even a kit to set up an outdoor event with friends using a projector. 
                                <br><br>
                                Despite the novelty of these ideas, we each aligned on another solution to move forward with an event box that included ingredients for a cocktail and dessert happy hour. The idea provided the multi-sensory experience users wanted, it allowed for passive interaction with local bartenders, and it created an avenue for social interaction with friends to discuss the drinks they made and how they were. 
                                <br><br>
                                We built upon this idea to recreate the “night out” experience that our users kept mentioning, complete with drinks, games, food, and discussion. The event box would provide all the requisite elements for enjoyment in-home, accompanied by a virtual performance played over Zoom that theatergoers could then discuss with their friends in a breakout room. The breakout rooms would create a more explicit prompt for users to discuss the show with their friends, something that had been previously been brough up as core to the theater’s appeal

                                        Making a cocktail and sharing that experience with your friends just feels more accessible and fun for a virtual experience than some other events, like cooking a meal or making art. I think it balances the line between passive and engaging really well

                                But how do you test such an immersive experience effectively? Our team was additionally challenged by the inability to go outside our households to conduct testing, due to COVID protocols. To adapt, we instead looked inwards and tested the experience with members of our household. 
                                <br><br>
                                We recreated the box using pieces of paper to imitate its elements (popcorn, dessert, drink ingredients, ticket stubs, stickers, and various other paraphernalia). We placed the box at the front door of our participants’ homes, then began our prompt asking them to open the door because their box had arrived. Once they had unpacked the box, we asked them to dial into the Zoom call to begin watching the performance. 
                                <br><br>
                                We simulated a Zoom performance by having another member of the team open a Zoom room, act as a KST host, and play a pre-recorded drink-making tutorial and performance snippet that matched the theme of our box, then had participants sent to a “breakout room” where we were waiting with a frame that we used as a Zoom frame to simulate a Zoom conversation. 
                                <br><br>
                                We were able to chat about the play and get their thoughts on the performance, thereby simulating the entire end-to-end experience at a low enough fidelity to support changes. Once the experience was concluded, we then switched over to acting as an interviewer and collected their thoughts on the experience while their sentiments were still fresh

During this screen, the event host welcomes the participant to the event.

                                Although our interviewees were generally positive about the event box, they also had several criticisms.
                                <br><br>
                                They hated the Zoom breakout rooms. They wanted the freedom to communicate with friends on their platform of choice, and saw the box acting as a conversation-starter, with no need for a provided platform to have those conversations. They also disliked Zoom as a platform for leisurely activities, suggesting Instagram Live as a medium.
                                <br><br>
                                The structure of the event was unsatisfactory. Users wanted the fun cocktail event before the show so they didn’t feel obligated to sit through the entire show to “get to the fun stuff”. The show itself felt flat and users wanted us to incorporate social elements within the show, like trivia at intermission. They were also bewildered by the email notification they received – they wanted more information about the box they were ordering beforehand, especially given how the entire experience hinged on its contents.
                                <br><br>
                                The box’s content also felt a little “gimmicky”. Users appreciated the food and drink ingredients, but the stickers and loyalty cards had no ties to theater and felt tacked-on. Instead, users wanted artifacts that referenced actual theater artifacts, like playbills. The box itself also felt boring – users wanted unboxings to be exciting, but without drawing unnecessary attention to their boxes from potential thieves.

                                        I hate Zoom with a passion. I have all my work calls on it, pretty much everything productivity-related. The last thing I want is to spend my free time on a weekend on Zoom. I don’t care how cool the event is, I just associate too many bad memories with it, especially if I’m basically being forced to talk to my friend after a show like it’s a homework assignment

                                        I think there are some cool elements here, but the box just isn’t coming together for me right now. It just feels like a cheap sales tactic by KST. Why are you giving me a loyalty card? I would never get a box more than once a month, so it just feels slimy. Why not give me a playbill to actually remember the performance?

                                But how do you test such an immersive experience effectively? Our team was additionally challenged by the inability to go outside our households to conduct testing, due to COVID protocols. To adapt, we instead looked inwards and tested the experience with members of our household. 
                                <br><br>
                                We recreated the box using pieces of paper to imitate its elements (popcorn, dessert, drink ingredients, ticket stubs, stickers, and various other paraphernalia). We placed the box at the front door of our participants’ homes, then began our prompt asking them to open the door because their box had arrived. Once they had unpacked the box, we asked them to dial into the Zoom call to begin watching the performance. 
                                <br><br>
                                We simulated a Zoom performance by having another member of the team open a Zoom room, act as a KST host, and play a pre-recorded drink-making tutorial and performance snippet that matched the theme of our box, then had participants sent to a “breakout room” where we were waiting with a frame that we used as a Zoom frame to simulate a Zoom conversation. 
                                <br><br>
                                We were able to chat about the play and get their thoughts on the performance, thereby simulating the entire end-to-end experience at a low enough fidelity to support changes. Once the experience was concluded, we then switched over to acting as an interviewer and collected their thoughts on the experience while their sentiments were still fresh

                                        Through experience prototyping, users can provide highly detailed and actionable feedback on extremely low-fidelity prototypes, as long as they are immersed in their experience. By treating the prototype as a prompt for users to imagine a scenario instead of a fully-fleshed concept, users will fill in the gaps.

                                        Zoom is a death spell for a leisurely solution – the associations it has with productivity are too strong to overcome for most. Use social media platforms to build connections instead, but make it easy for users to communicate with one another on their platform of choice

                                We presented our findings to KST in the form of a poster and received positive feedback again. They loved how intertwined the box was to the theater’s core mission of bringing communities together with pandemic-compliant initiatives. The theater had tried similar initiatives of pre-packaged boxes of food available for audiences to pick up and watch with virtual shows, but KST’s leadership liked how this idea brought that to another level, creating an entire experience around the activities that normally encompass a night out at the theater.

                                The solution was also commended for being feasible and less technology-heavy, which both respected KST’s budgetary constraints and accommodated the relatively low technology literacy of many of its older patrons, which made up a significant chunk of the KST community. Where the solution did use technology (IG Live), KST appreciated our attempt to work with KST’s strengths and leverage their influential Instagram page as the hub for our event.

                                With this being my first real UX research project, I learned an unbelievable amount. More than anything else, I learned just how powerful effective UX research can be in guiding a team towards a solution. At every juncture where we faced significant ambiguity, we were able to achieve clarity by asking our users the right questions. Moving forward, I’ll be looking constantly hone my executions with user feedback

                                        I can’t tell you how many different food boxes we’ve put together and had fail because it’s just too much to ask people to come and pick up the food themselves.
