                            I designed a conceptual dashboard that reconciled the diverse perspectives of Adidas’ fashion designers, product managers, and executives so they could align on the insights that mattered in building shoes that were profitable, stylish, and desirable.

                        <p>
                            Adidas has long been considered a leader in the design of footwear, but with increasing team scale and competing priorities, the organization has struggled to develop a cohesive view of what its shoes of the future should look like. As part of a class project, our team sought to understand how we could unite the distinct perspectives and skillsets of product teams to better complement one another.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Solution</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            The “Impossible is Nothing” dashboard creates common ground and understanding between three key personas as they seek to improve the performance of Adidas’s fashion sneakers segment. It does so by identifying the key goals and commonalities that these personas have, and using those as an anchor point to provide a multi-dimensional lens on shoe performance and prototypes.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Outcomes</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            We presented this final dashboard prototype to a group of panelists impersonating the three distinct personas - fashion designer, product manager, and global executive. All panelists appreciated the dashboard’s emphasis on displaying actionable data that was still diverse enough to inform each team member’s focus in the shoe design process. With our dashboard, teams could finally empathize with the perspectives of their peers.

                                    In this final design, users are first greeted with an overview page that presents a view of Adidas’ performance across three major dimensions – customer insights, social media trends, and financial performance. These three dimensions cater to the preferred method of assessing performance that a product manager (customer insights) fashion designer (social media trends) and a global executive (financial performance) would have. We also studied areas of overlapping interest between stakeholders, and ordered dashboard sections accordingly (e.g., most compelling sections in the top left, least at the bottom right) in keeping with <a href="https://uxplanet.org/z-shaped-pattern-for-reading-web-content-ce1135f92f1c" target="_blank">Z-pattern hierarchies</a>. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    With all the insights on customer preferences providing by the overview page, we designed the second page of the dashboard to channel those insights into action. 
                                    Users can understand whether existing prototypes are attuned to what customers find desirable or what is trending on social media. The page also offers an overview of all the latest shoe designs with metrics on the elements that matter most to all three stakeholders. Designers can determine the changes they need to make to the shoe, while executives and product managers can weigh in with the financial and customer data provided.                                        
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Designers can also zero in on a specific shoe to focus their attention. When switching to this view, the shoe slideshow gallery at the top left switches to a 360-degree view of the specific shoe they’re looking at. All graphs are updated to provide views of the specific shoe against peer comparables to make more context-driven decisions on the areas to improve. With eco-friendliness a key consideration for designers, they can also identify alternative shoe composition suggestions without losing track of the other elements that matter to customers.

                        <p><strong>Use Real Data: </strong>Within the scope of this project, the emphasis was on a thoughtfully designed dashboard that catered to the tastes of a diverse set of stakeholders. Although I tried to incorporate realistic data in the mockups, I would have wanted to see if the views were valuable and actionable to stakeholders when depicting real data.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do User Testing: </strong>This project provided our team with three “persona cards” to build for, with all information pre-collected. This forced us to make some assumptions about these stakeholders’ needs. I would have loved to test our mockups with actual shoe designers, product managers, and executives to see if our assumptions held water.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do More Competitor Research: </strong>Although we spent time looking at best-in-class dashboards, most of them involved data visualizations in unrelated fields (e.g., wealth management). I would’ve been interested to study more production dashboards to glean any valuable ideas that we could adapt for our purposes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Stay Focused on User Needs: </strong>It was a learning curve to treat the Adidas persona cards as legitimate user research. Although we did eventually course-correct, we initially often made assumptions about the personas instead of referencing information provided. Consequently, our initial dashboard views were too generic and lacked focus.</p>
                        <p><strong>Wait Before Ramping Up Fidelity: </strong>Our team moved almost immediately from rough paper sketches to a detailed Figma prototype. The higher visual fidelity was time-consuming to achieve and focused on shallow issues (e.g., color choices) instead of deeper concerns about the dashboard’s purpose, which we had to dedicate more time to in later phases.</p>
                        <p><strong>Design Modular Prototypes: </strong>We neglected any sort of design system in our initial prototype development and had major pains in adjusting our prototype as a result. By project-end, we had developed an entire component-based design system in Figma, but wasted significant time in the interim.</p>

                        <p><strong>Using Animations to Complement Content: </strong>In building the dashboard, I delved into Protopie and gained a far more nuanced understanding of how animations can both draw the eye and prove distracting depending on their usage. By the project’s end, I was able to create compelling animations that emphasized the right content at the right time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Visualizing Complex Information: </strong>Coming from consulting, I had worked extensively with data to create informationally dense visualizations, but this project helped me combine that expertise with a visual sense to create data visualizations that were both informative and visually delightful. These visualizations could please a fashion designer and a global executive!</p>
                        <p><strong>Prioritizing Information that Actually Matters: </strong>I firmly believe that the most important decisions in a dashboard involve deciding what information to not include, and this project gave me the comfort to make those decisions. It’s imperative to focus on the most salient user needs and constantly question whether the information provided serves those needs and empowers users.</p>

                                The importance of diversity extends beyond inclusion and representation of ethnicities, genders, or sexualities. Although it is less-mentioned, another critical part of any team’s success is their cognitive diversity, which enhances a company’s innovation by 20%, reduces risks by 30% and eases decisions’ implementation, according to Deloitte.
                                <br><br>
                                Despite the benefits, cognitive diversity can be elusive - it often involves instilling appreciation for varying perspectives, which can be difficult to do in siloed organizations where employees rarely explore the value of approaches beyond their bubble. 
                                <br><br>
                                From our project brief, Adidas is one such organization, where shoes’ product teams have had difficulty appreciating one another’s perspectives, and company executives’ focus on profitability consistently dominates conversation on how to iterate on shoe designs. 
                                <br><br>
                                Within this context, our team’s task was to develop a dashboard that could bridge the gap in understanding between three personas on a representative product team - Ansela, the Global VP for Adidas Fashion Sneakers, Kenny, the Director of Fashion Sneaker Marketing for North America, and SOS, a designer for Adidas Fashion Sneakers. With our dashboard, we aimed to transform the team’s cognitive diversity from a bottleneck into a strength.

                                We had been provided with two pieces of information – persona cards for the three members of a typical product team at Adidas (fashion designer, product manager, and financial executive), and sales + review data for one of Adidas’ shoes and its closest competitor.
                                <br><br>
                                With this information, we looked to evaluate the current state of Adidas’ data collection and shoe reviews. How were decisions currently being made on shoe designs? What were the major issues with shoes that a dashboard would need to address? What elements did the shoes do right that the dashboard would need to continue to monitor?
                                <br><br>
                                We started categorizing our findings into three sections – roses, buds, and thorns. A rose (pink sticky) indicated something Adidas was doing well and should continue to monitor, a bud (green sticky) indicated a potential opportunity for data collection, and a thorn (blue sticky) indicated issues that the dashboard would need to address.
                                <br><br>
                                It became clear that this view was helpful in understanding initial opportunities for the dashboard based off the current state, but that it didn’t provide a nuanced view of how those opportunities (or the dashboard) could serve the needs of any specific persona. These stickies would need to be mapped in the broader context of the personas’ goals and motivations.

                                Although we had isolated high-potential information to showcase in our dashboard, we still hadn’t thought too deeply about how this data would actually empower or aid our three personas. We decided to reorganize our data into a Venn Diagram and identify which persona would find certain data elements useful.
                                <br><br>
                                We started with a current-state view. To begin, our persona cards shed light on the motivations and goals of the personas. We noted these motivations with relational arrows between Venn circles. Given those relationships, we sorted data that was available in the current state into the relevant circles.
                                <br><br>
                                This allowed us to progress to our second Venn diagram – the future state view. We combined the opportunities we had identified from our rose/bud/thorn exercise and the persona cards’ details on what each persona cared about in designing a shoe, and built an ideal future-state – if data was no issue, what would each persona want to know before they launched a shoe? 
                                <br><br>
                                From this view, we were able to see just how many potential datapoints we could include in our dashboard – 30+ categories that could prove useful to 1+ persona. This view also helped us understand just how many potential sources of data we could pull in to build our dashboard. How could we present all this information in a way that was digestible and useful to our personas?

                                Now that our team understood what information our personas would benefit from having on the dashboard, we shifted gears to ideation and thinking through how to display this information effectively. Our team made the mistake of not further prioritizing the information we should show on our dashboard, instead focusing efforts on how to most effectively display all potentially valuable data in a single tool. 
                                <br><br> 
                                To facilitate diversity of thought, each of us spent time individually ideating on the dashboard’s potential layout, then discussed elements of overlap. In our meeting, we quickly aligned on the idea of a tabular view, where each tab would focus on one lens of data (e.g., shoe production, web & social, finance), and each persona could focus on the tabs that interested them. With each persona having such different perspectives and needs, this seemed like the most intuitive way to cater to each perspective.
                                <br><br>
                                With this tabular view, we could also accommodate the unique ways each persona ingested data, featuring more traditional charts and graphs for Ansela, and more visual elements for Sos or Kenny.

                                We began to translate our thinking into a high-fidelity prototype, confident that we had cracked the secret to the perfect dashboard. After brainstorming the potentially valuable graphs to include in the dashboard and consolidating them into the 16 most relevant ones, we began to see four categories emerge in the information they provided – Finance, Customer Needs, Web & Social Media, and Shoe Production. 
                                <br><br>
                                These categories served as our tabs. Each persona could gravitate towards the tabs that served them without being bombarded with unnecessary information from other tabs. As we began to develop these graphs, we struggled to understand the right cut of the data to provide. We hypothesized that the right view was context-dependent, and that instead of being declarative, we should allow the user to determine the optimal view of the graph.
                                <br><br>
                                With this logic, we built each graph to be interactive. Users could click on a graph to then filter the view by shoe type, gender, and various other metrics. In our view, this allowed the dashboard to “always be right” in providing the most relevant view to users.

                                We showcased our dashboard as part of a group critique in class. From our critique, we realized our dashboard had mistaken comprehensiveness for utility. Ultimately, the role of a dashboard shouldn’t be to serve as a repository of data visualizations; instead its goal should be to provide relevant and actionable information that help users achieve a specific goal. We were wrong in trying to be everything to everyone.
                                <br><br>
                                That all started with defining the central goal itself – we wanted to align on a goal that would unite the seemingly divergent interests of Ansela, Kenny and Sos. 
                                <br><br>
                                We realized that although each persona took different approaches, they were all in service of designing better sneakers. This goal was central to the purpose of the product team itself and could help the personas focus more on collaborative work efforts.  Following from that, all our dashboard information should provide actionable information to improve sneaker design.
                                <br><br>
                                We revisited our dashboard and its myriad visualizations, and conducted a Remove-Keep- Modify exercise. We assessed whether each visualization could further our stakeholders’ central goal in an actionable way, and the best way to present that visualization if it was relevant. With this lens, we arrived at a significantly reduced and focused subset of graphs which complemented each other, rather than competing for attention.

                                We needed to move past the tabular view we had before, which reinforced siloed working. Instead, our dashboard should aim to promote discussion and collaboration as its users <i>design better shoes</i> together.
                                <br><br>
                                To reinforce this behavior, we restructured our dashboard to have three main pages – a performance overview page, a prototype production page, and a production deep-dive page.

                                On the first page, users could understand Adidas’ current state, both to identify key trends that they could incorporate into future designs, and to understand whether recent launches were successful. Users could then translate those insights to the second page and confirm whether upcoming launches were incorporating findings, with the option to do a deeper analysis of specific shoes on the third page. 
                                <br><br>
                                With each page serving a specific purpose, we refreshed the visualizations on each page to support that purpose. We got rid of data that could be easily found or didn’t drive action, such as Instagram followers.

                                Another group critique helped confirm that we were closer to creating a useful dashboard, but that it could still feel like a “collection of visualizations” rather than a hub for decision-making. To address this issue, we undertook two actions.
                                <br><br>
                                First, we did another pass of our visualizations, forcing ourselves to ideate specific scenarios where a persona could take action for each graph (e.g., If Kenny sees Nike has the top hashtag, he can go on Twitter to learn more). Where we couldn’t think of a clear scenario, we removed the visualization from the dashboard.
                                <br><br>
                                Second, we were more choiceful in the dashboard’s layout. We had previously selected a layout that allowed all the visualizations to fit (yikes), but we now clustered elements that provided related information, then created a hierarchy for clusters based off how many personas the cluster was informative to (e.g., customer insights helped all three personas, and so was in the top left). We employed a z-pattern hierarchy system. 
                                <br><br>
                                We also refined our dashboard controls. Our project imposed constraints where we were only allowed to institute a single physical control to manage the dashboard. To easily toggle between pages, we employed a joystick control. We instituted navigation callouts on the left and top of the dashboard to signal to users both where they were in the dashboard, and where they could navigate.

                                Although our visualizations were now clear and focused, we also had to address their dynamism. We imagined our visualizations to provide live views of the data they represented, to optimize their actionability and relevance. 
                                <br><br> 
                                To accommodate this dynamism, we introduced motion and animation into the visualizations. Instead of having them refresh at arbitrary points and risk our users making decision on outdated data, we thought animations could provide a smoother, live “refresh” experience.
                                <br><br> 
                                We also designed our animations to indicate how the data was changing (e.g., as new social media trends emerged, they “climbed” the graph, while out-of-date trends “fell” down. By doing this, we were able to use animation to both swap in new information and communicate how that information was impacting what the users were seeing. By doing this, we could draw users’ attention when there were major changes to the data and make significant changes more digestible.

                                Given just how many different data sources our dashboard was aiming to draw from, we also realized that our users would likely face material load times when the dashboard switched views. We wanted to be transparent with users about those load times, but we also wanted to minimize their frustrations.
                                <br><br>
                                Motion and animation helped us solve this issue. We instituted loading animations upon page loads across all our dashboard pages, where data would spend 2-3 seconds “appearing”. This animation made the load-in less jarring by temporarily distracting users until the data was loaded.
                                <br><br>
                                We also introduced motion and animation as a means to attract and engage users. We knew that Sos and Kenny were wary of data visualizations, and found them less engaging than Ansela. To attract them, we instituted aesthetically pleasing visualizations (e.g., rotating shoes, shoe slideshows) that helped convey information better than static images of the shoes, but also made the dashboard itself more interactive and visual, in accordance with Kenny and Sos’s personalities.

                                        Motion and animation are great tools for making a dashboard feel more lively, but they need to be used with purpose to prevent them from feeling distracting or reducing the dashboard's effectiveness

                                        Motion and animation are most effective when they are used to tell the story of the data, so that a user does not even need to look at the actual figures to know how the data has changed

                                We closed off this project with a pitch presentation to a guest panel, which included actors playing the personas of Ansela, Kenny, and Sos. 
                                <br><br>
                                The pitch was received with overwhelming praise, with all personas seeming to find value from the dashboard, and commenting that it helped them build empathy for other perspectives that they would otherwise never have. We were able to achieve our goal of creating a single view that spoke to three distinct personas.
                                <br><br>
                                In reflecting on the project, I’m cognizant of how close our team was to creating an encyclopedia instead of a website. My biggest takeaway from this project is just how critical it is to define the goals and desired outcomes of a solution before designing any of it. With that goal in mind, decision-making is simplified by assessing whether a design choice aligns to the goal. Without such a goal, it is easy to make design choices that build a “prettier” solution but that serve no deeper purpose. 
                                <br><br>
                                Similarly, I’m struck by the <a href="https://www.designkit.org/methods/66" target="_blank">power of “why”</a>. Particularly in group projects, it’s easy to make decisions because they are agreeable, without questioning their soundness or alignment with user needs. This project helped me challenge that mindset, and constantly question our process so that all decisions enhanced our value to our personas.

                                        I have two major takeaways. First, building around a focused goal is instrumental in delivering value because it ensures all information provided is genuinely useful. Second, motion is incredible—it can add character, communicate function, and turn awkward transitions beautiful. This fledgling designer has added another tool to his toolkit.

The diversity of ideas we were able to come up with together as a group was greater than anything we would have been able to come up with on our own.
