                        <p>
                            Social media is contributing an <a href= "https://www.journalism.org/2019/10/02/americans-are-wary-of-the-role-social-media-sites-play-in-delivering-the-news/" target= "_blank">increasingly large share of news </a>consumed across America, all while pushing news based off <a href= "https://www.fastcompany.com/3066586/the-year-dark-patterns-won" target= "_blank">anticipated engagement levels instead of credibility</a>. With this incentive systems in place, users are being shown more and more news with misleading or flat-out false information (also known as “fake news”). With these systemic issues unlikely to change, the onus is falling on readers to determine news credibility. How can we make this daunting task easier for social media users?
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Solution</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            Ghost Hunters is a mobile-based game that makes it feel less daunting to identify the credibility of news. On the surface, it is an imposter-style game, where users parse through news to identify ways to defeat an evil demon. But through embedded design techniques, the game also teaches users how to think more critically about news and ties critical thinking to social rewards, making it easier and more desirable for them to apply the in-game analytical methods within their own lives.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Outcomes</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            We tested our hi-fi prototype with a representative set of users – active users of social media. These users noted how well the game balanced enjoyable elements like social dynamics (e.g., teaming up to catch the demon) with critical thinking skills to create a rewarding experience. We also presented our prototype to <a href= "https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/geoff-kaufman" target= "_blank">Geoff Kaufman</a> (a leading researcher in embedded design in gaming for social impact), who loved our game’s thoughtful and effective use of various psychological principles to empower players to combat fake news.

                                <p>
                                    One of the hardest parts of casual game design is creating an experience that is immersive and challenging while still being accessible. That often places significant pressure on a game’s tutorial to get players up to speed without feeling like an encyclopedia.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Our game’s tutorial addresses this issue by acting as an interactive walkthrough. We use a “show, don’t tell” technique in which players are guided through the game’s various components by the two main characters of the game – Juju the friendly ghost and Zuzu the evil ghost. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    By leveraging both characters, the tutorial creates a clear distinction between the gameplay elements catered to the ghost hunter mode and the demon mode of the game.                                     
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Ghost Hunter Gameplay</span></h5>
                                <p>
                                    Players are randomly assigned to play as either a ghost hunter or a demon. Ghost hunters need to exorcise the demon from the house by identifying credible pieces of news that signal which rituals effectively weaken the demon.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Gameplay leverages several psychological principles to ensure our game is both enjoyable and motivates behavioral change. The game’s setting and use of fictional news disguises its true purpose and prevents players’ personal political beliefs from influencing their assessment of news. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Juju’s role as an optional guide mimics real avenues for fact-checking news. Players are incentivized to fact-check in the game and even form a bond with Juju, and their habitual fact-checking, along with the elements they investigate, then carry over to real world assessment.                                    
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Demon Gameplay</span></h5>
                                <p>
                                    One player in each game is “possessed” by the demon and acts to manipulate news and persuade players to follow recommendations from these uncredible sources.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Demons are partnered with Zuzu, who can manipulate uncredible news sources to raise their perceived legitimacy. By doing so, players learn more about common tricks that sensationalist articles use to raise their trustworthiness by employing those tricks themselves, and become more wary of these tactics both in future games when they are ghost hunters, and in real life.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Our research also showed that adding an antagonist role also helped increase players’ moral sensitivity to the importance of fake news. By crafting misinformation, players would actually become more attuned to the importance of preventing its spread in real life.                                    
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Voting</span></h5>
                                <p>
                                    At the end of rounds, all players bring one piece of news they’ve selected into a voting round, and players vote on one piece of uncredible news to discard. The remaining news’ rituals are then tried out. Four pieces of news need to be credible to weaken the demon and progress to the next round.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Before voting, players have two minutes to discuss and identify the least credible source of news, with the demon trying to persuade players to vote out a credible news source. Players that bring credible news and effectively identify uncredible news are celebrated, creating an incentive for ghost hunters and demons alike to think critically.

                                    This social proofing system is a powerful motivator in-game, with players growing to associate critical reading of news with a higher sense of self in real life.

                            <strong>Test the effectiveness of Ghost Hunter’s intervention: </strong>Determining the successfulness of our intervention would likely require an extended study where we examine users’ rate of sharing uncredible news before and after playing our game for an extended length. This would require significant resources but would be invaluable in understanding our game’s effectiveness. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Develop a more playable prototype: </strong>We effectively simulated a playable demo of our game for testing purposes, but this required significant work by our team behind the scenes to action users’ inputs, which limited immersion. With a fully coded version, we could better test the game’s enjoyability by having users play and interact with each other in a more realistic way.

                            <strong>Expand upon the game’s teaching moments: </strong>Our primary means of teaching critical thinking skills is by training users to leverage Juju and his categories of news analysis. I’d love to layer in additional factors (e.g., news that was recommended by a family member) to train users on other elements that cause people to fall prey to fake news.

                            <strong>Proactively scope out the entire project: </strong>Our team’s workload dramatically increased at the project’s tail-end because we underestimated the efforts required to design and test prototypes. Going back, I would have scoped out the project’s full requirements from the onset so we could get a head start on more challenging elements that came later in the project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Worry less (and more) about lo-fi prototypes’ visual finish: </strong>During lo-fi testing, our team tested three prototypes in parallel, independently from each other. Some were so visually polished that users felt guilty about calling out any issues, and others were so crude that they were barely legible. In retrospect, the optimal designs would have been in the middle to encourage user feedback without sabotaging basic playability.

                            <strong>Interview a more diverse sample size: </strong>Although our interviewees frequently shared fake news, they were all also heavily liberal, huge proponents of stopping fake news, and under 35. I would have liked a more diverse pool to get a more representative view of Americans’ reasoning for sharing fake news.

                            <strong>Translating user feedback into actionable changes: </strong>
                            Our initial user tests produced a laundry list of recommended changes as users weighed in on every potential improvement. Motivated by time constraints and feasibility, I became far better at consolidating feedback and prioritizing changes, understanding how to differentiate between low-level concerns and foundational issues that underpinned numerous tests.

                            <strong>Integrating persuasive design principles into a solution: </strong>
                            This project exposed me to persuasive design principles for the first time. Although they are often used for morally dubious reasons (e.g., <a href= "https://darkpatterns.org/"   target= "_blank"> dark patterns</a>), I also learned how much social good these principles can do by subliminally and explicitly motivating people to pursue more socially advantageous goals

                            <strong>Designing enjoyable and immersive experiences: </strong>
                            I had also never designed a game before this project. I became significantly more skilled at understanding the components of an entertaining experience, from writing enjoyable copy to making task completion more delightful, to visual design principles like color and layout that reduce cognitive load.

More than half of U.S. adults got their news from social media often or sometimes in 2019 (55%), and that figure has been creeping up for over 5 years.

                                Social media newsfeeds are not built around promoting facts. Facebook’s algorithm carefully serves news to users based off their observed opinions and optimizes for engagement, which creates a <a href = "https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308" target = "_blank"> breeding ground for sensationalist, fact-poor articles that rile emotions</a>. Fake news is even being <a href = "https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13850230/fake-news-sites-google-search-facebook-instant-articles" target = "_blank">purposely beautified by social media sites</a> to lower readers’ guards and promote engagement with these articles.

                                We wanted to understand how social media users felt about this dilemma. We conducted initial interviews of active social media users across various demographics using the <a href = "http://imaginari.es/new-metaphors/" target = "_blank">New Metaphors technique</a>, which can help surface underlying perspectives on topics. Our interviewees described their dilemma – they didn’t know how to tell truth from lies even though they desperately wanted to and had given up on even trying, engaging with articles based off interest instead of legitimacy. Despite their awareness of the issue, they found it impossible to leave social media altogether – it was far too convenient, and a hub for all their connections. How could we help social media users take back control of their newsfeed and feel capable of differentiating fact from fiction?

                                To understand the broader context behind the prevalence of fake news and why it was taking up a larger share of people’s newsfeeds, our team thought it would be best to start with the existing knowledge base. We reviewed academic papers and interviewed expert researchers of fake news, and learned three things.
                                <br><br>
                                First, despite algorithmic machinations, ultimately the spread of fake news is people’s fault. Although we should blame the creators of fake news, we should also <a href= "http://henryjenkins.org/blog/2009/02/if_it_doesnt_spread_its_dead_p_1.html" target="_blank">blame those who spread it carelessly</a> instead of treating them as “passive carriers” of a disease.
                                <br><br>
                                Second, the biggest reason why people spread fake news is because <a href= "https://www.academia.edu/33621784/Navigating_an_Immersive_Narratology_Factors_to_Explain_the_Reception_of_Fake_News" target= “_blank”> they have grown to trust familiar narratives</a>. Since social media oftentimes pushes news that aligns with our opinions, we accept and share those opinions without analyzing the underlying facts.
                                <br><br>
                                But there is hope. Simply by <a href= "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Priming-critical-thinking%3A-Simple-interventions-the-Lutzke-Drummond/cf2e980885da13adff5e4471d5f2f9146dc333a1" target ="_blank"> asking participants to evaluate the credibility of a source </a>, a researcher was able to reduce their likelihood of liking, sharing, and trusting fake news without impacting their perception of genuinely credible news. Despite the role readers have to play in fake news’ spread, they can also easily stem its virality.

                                If it was so easy for readers to see through the lies of uncredible news, then why did they believe it in the first place? To uncover these factors, we decided to interview social media users that actively engage with news on their feed. We structured our interview into three parts. 
                                <br><br>
                                First, we asked users to talk about why they shared news. We then asked them to pull up the last shared article from their newsfeed and discuss their motivation for sharing it. Lastly, we structured an activity to identify users’ ability to differentiate credible from uncredible news.
                                <br><br>
                                We selected two articles which varied significantly in their credibility. As a team, we scored these articles on several elements that were <a href = “https://libguides.rutgers.edu/fake_news” target = “_blank”> core to assessing the credibility of news articles</a> and assigned them “fakeness scores”. We asked interviewees to interact with both articles as if they were on their newsfeed, then asked them to score the articles’ credibility.
                                <br><br>
                                Across the board, interviewees claimed to care a lot about sharing thoughtful, credible news that made them look smart. Despite this, they all shared highly uncredible articles to their feed, full with assumptions and narratives unsupported by facts. Our biggest insight came from interviewees’ credibility scoring exercise, in which they assigned both articles near-identical scores despite their drastically different levels of credibility, simply because both had credible-seeming images, headlines, and source names.

                                Our secondary and user research had made a few things clear. Despite the (rightful) blame social media algorithms get for the spread of fake news, readers should also be held accountable for their contributions. But readers themselves are not malicious – instead they are just easily tricked into believing articles’ credibility through superficial indicators like the apparent credibility of a headline, source name, prose, or imagery. 
                                <br><br>
                                In their natural state, readers will process information through their first system of cognition (called System 1), in which they draw conclusions automatically and quickly using peripheral cues. Research has shown that by forcing readers to think more critically with their second system of cognition (called System 2), we could get them to be more critical and easily identify an article’s actual credibility. 
                                <br><br>
                                Our intervention needed to trigger this System 2 thinking, either by giving readers even more motivation to think critically about everything they read, or by making them more skilled at assessing article credibility, so that using their System 2 cognition wasn’t so taxing. With that in mind, we aligned on our project focus:

                                Now that we had a focus area, we shifted gears to thinking about the realm of possible solutions. To ensure we were fully exploring all possible solutions, our team decided to independently brainstorm 15 one-sentence ideas based off the research we’d done, then come together to investigate commonalities between ideas. After clustering our ideas, we arrived at three particularly promising focus areas, which we then collectively fleshed out:
                                <ol>
                                <li><strong>Narrative-based games to immerse players: </strong> Immerse players in a fictionalized scenario that mixes content relevant to identifying misinformation with off-topic content that keeps players from raising their guards. Players would be asked to identify and critically analyze misinformation in order to catch a perpetrator that is purposely trying to spread misinformation</li>
                                <li><strong>Gamifying the real-life Facebook experience: </strong>Since one of the main motivations for sharing news in the first place is to feel smarter, we can gamify this experience with Scholar Badges, which get associated with a user’s profile every time they take a recommended action (e.g., clicking an article link before sharing). This creates a social reward system tied to critical thinking</li>
                                <li><strong>Creating empathy for other perspectives: </strong>Readers have been shown to be far less critical of perspectives that align with their own, and far more critical of dissenting opinions. To encourage criticality of all perspectives, we could develop an empathy-building game, in which players take on a role that demonstrates the validity of dissenting opinions</li>
                                </ol>

                                        At the end of the day, I want to share things that are representative of my own opinions and feelings.

                                We decided to present our ideas as pitches to our peers and professors within our persuasive design class to get quick, valuable feedback focused on the potential effectiveness of the intervention technique. Once we could settle on an intervention technique, we could iterate on its execution with our users. 
                                <br><br>
                                Our peers were relatively split on our first two ideas. For the first idea, they liked the dual-role of the game, which embedded critical thinking skills in multiple ways. They also thought the deliberate disguising of the intervention as a game would encourage replays and engagement levels. However, they noted that the game would need to avoid being too educational, for fear of losing its enjoyability.
                                <br><br>
                                Our peers felt that social reward systems were a powerful incentive system and liked its usage in the second game, but they also felt like there were several potential pitfalls. How could we prevent users from gaming the system (e.g., clicking to news but then immediately closing the article)? How could we create objective measures of critical thinking? How would we actually implement this?
                                <br><br>
                                Our last idea received little acclaim. Most of our peers agreed that convincing readers to empathize with “the other side of the aisle” was a lost cause in today’s political climate, where political values were too closely tied to personal identity.

                                With feedback received, the narrative-based game looked like the obvious choice to move forward with – it had the greatest potential to educate users, felt more feasible to execute, and avoided potential ethical dilemmas from malicious players.
                                <br><br>
                                But the idea was still relatively nascent. To explore potential methods of execution, we reverted back to generative ideation, where we individually brainstormed a potential narrative and rudimentary game mechanics before coming together to discuss. We arrived at three potential solutions, then stress-tested them along two elements – how well were we integrating persuasive design principles into these games, and how enjoyable was this game?
                                <br><br>
                                After our analysis, we were able to narrow down our selection to a single game idea – Ghost Hunters. The game would assign players to the role of ghost hunters or demon. Ghost hunters would have to search a haunted house for potential news regarding exorcism rituals and determine which ritual to perform, based off news credibility. Meanwhile, the demon, disguised as a ghost hunter, would have to manipulate news throughout the house in an attempt to sabotage the exorcism ritual. 
                                <br><br>
                                Once all players had selected a piece of news and an associated ritual to perform, all players would discuss and vote upon the ritual to perform. The demon would try to lead ghost hunters towards uncredible rituals, all while trying not to expose themselves.

                                As we fleshed out the concept, we realized that Ghost Hunters could weave in a myriad of persuasive design principles to aid our intervention:
                                <ul>
                                <li><strong>Obfuscation / Distancing: </strong>We set the game in a haunted house and tasked players with finding news about exorcism rituals. Within this fictional context, players would be less likely to think about the true intent of the game, and would focus on evaluating news credibility instead of political connotations. This would help make the intervention more effective</li>
                                <li><strong>System 2 Thinking: </strong>Players would be asked to constantly evaluate the credibility of news in order to advance, training more System 2 thinking. They’d also be armed with a guidebook to help guide their investigating, training users on the most efficient / effective elements to search for to determine news credibility </li>
                                <li><strong>Consistency and Commitment: </strong>We’d make news easy to investigate at first, then slowly increase the difficulty. Players would remain invested because they’ve “come so far”, making them willing to take on new challenges and strengthen their skills</li>
                                <li><strong>Social Proof: </strong>During voting, players that think critically would contribute to wins and gain social status. This association between critical thinking and increased sense of self should translate to the real world</li>
                                <li><strong>Increased Moral Sensitivity: </strong>By playing as the demon, players would actually become more attuned to the importance of combating fake news.</li>
                                </ul>
                                We had the scaffolding and concept of our game in place. Now we needed to bring it together with a compelling design that actually made gameplay enjoyable.

                                    Immoral virtual behaviors are capable of eliciting guilt. More importantly, the guilt elicited by gameplay led to intuition-specific increases in the salience of violated moral foundations.

                                Although we had settled on a concept, the critique of Scholar Badges and its ethical pitfalls made us realize that we needed to be similarly mindful of potentially unforeseen ethical issues posed by Ghost Hunters. To open our eyes to these issues, we leveraged <a href = "https://www.artefactgroup.com/case-studies/the-tarot-cards-of-tech/" target='_blank'> Artefact’s Tarot Cards of Tech</a>. These cards act as prompts, forcing us to consider worst-case scenarios in which our game is used for nefarious purposes. We uncovered some initial flaws that we worked to remedy.
                                <br><br>
                                We realized that bad actors could actually use our game to train themselves on techniques that effectively fool people to believing uncredible news. To throw them off the scent, we decided to remove all mention of “fake news” or real-life ties to news from our game, further obfuscating its purpose and taking it off the radar for bad actors.
                                <br><br>
                                With so much reading, people suffering from reading disabilities could also feel ostracized. Previous games had actually succeeded in getting players to <a href= "http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI2019/2exabs/LBW0178.pdf" target= "_blank">misattribute anxiety about a task to the scary atmosphere of the game instead</a>. We decided to leverage this tactic, and play up the “horror” element of our game.
                                <br><br>
                                We also realized that playing as the demon could be a stressful experience, especially since they are one vs. many. To help, we looked to specific tactics that made demon gameplay more enjoyable than regular gameplay, such as power-ups.

                                Despite being aligned in the overall narrative, mechanics, and intervention techniques of the game, our team still had varying opinions on how the game should be designed to maximize enjoyability. Instead of trying to hypothesize on which design choices would be superior, we decided to test them all out.
                                <br><br>
                                Our team elected to create three separate low-fidelity designs, each making consciously different design choices to test which choices appealed most to users.
                                <br><br>
                                Our first design had no guidebook. Instead, players had to use their critical thinking to compare articles and notice discrepancies, which would help them identify the credible choice. To add engagement, this design also added in ritual items throughout the house that players had to find in order to execute a recommended ritual. Players voted to exclude one ritual and perform the rest, as opposed to picking a single ritual to perform
                                <br><br>
                                Our second design incorporated a heavily detailed guidebook to help players ascertain news credibility. This design also asked players to vote for a ritual and for a person to cast it on, forcing players to think about who the demon could be.
                                <br><br>
                                The last design simplified everything. No demon and no rooms to navigate between. Players could choose between a set of ways to investigate news, then vote on a single article and its associated ritual.

                                We leveraged a parallel prototyping testing approach with a set of six interviewees. We had players complete the same three tasks for each of the games – navigate through pre-game content, complete a ghost hunter flow, and complete a demon flow (omitted for the last design). 
                                <br><br>
                                By asking players to complete the same task multiple times, they could develop more informed opinions about what they liked and disliked by taking a comparative approach. It made it easier for them to call out especially strong or weak elements of games now that they had context, and led to fewer superficial comments about visual design.
                                <br><br>
                                All the designs were received poorly. For ghost hunters, players called out how boring it was to read through the long, detailed articles we had constructed and admitted to skimming them by the end (not much critical thinking in that).
                                <br><br>
                                They noted that some sort of guidebook was essential, but that it just felt like an encyclopedia in its current form where winning was as simple as finding the right page of the guidebook.
                                <br><br>
                                Demon gameplay felt flat. Demons could manipulate practically any element of news so that it was indiscernible from real news and players felt that defeated the point of thinking critically. Moreover, with unlimited manipulations at their disposal, being a demon felt like an exercise in just going through articles and manipulating them.
                                <br><br>
                                The game itself was barely understandable too. With no tutorial, voting was confusing and players had no idea what to do at first.

                                To reduce the time spent reading articles, we doubled the number of articles across the house, and made each one short and snappy (no more than 100 words). We also created several different mediums for news and varied imagery, headlines, prose and sources across the articles to help users learn how to investigate these features instead of accepting their validity.
                                <br><br>
                                In lieu of a traditional guidebook, we introduce Juju, an interactive companion that users could ask for help in specific areas. With Juju, players didn’t have to read through an entire guidebook to find what they needed. They could only ask for Juju’s help once, to stop the guidebook from becoming overpowered.
                                <br><br>
                                We also introduced Zuzu to help demons manipulate news. Players could only manipulate one piece of news, and they had to bring that manipulated article with them to prevent interference with others’ news-reading. It was now hard to identify manipulated articles as uncredible, but not impossible. 
                                <br><br>
                                We also added in a dedicated tutorial section, taking players through the game’s rules to prevent confusion.

                                        By personifying the guidebook into this cute companion, I almost feel like I have this sidekick looking over my shoulder whenever I read any piece of news.

                                To mimic the social elements of gameplay, members of our team acted as other players in the game during the voting phase. The interviewee would go through a round as ghost hunter, then be sent to a breakout room to discuss their findings with their “teammates”, repeating this process for the demon flow.
                                <br><br>
                                This iteration had a significantly better reception. The players found the game far more enjoyable because they better understood the rules of the game. The demon gameplay was more fun with the balanced gameplay, and ghost hunters didn’t feel like they were at the mercy of the demon.

                                The major criticism of the game was its tutorial. Users still had multiple questions at the end of the tutorial because its length and static presentation made them prone to skimming and missing instructions. It needed to be shorter and more engaging to effectively teach users all about the game
                                <br><br>
                                Users also thought that Juju’s tips were too prescriptive. They wanted the tips to be more ambiguous and open to interpretation, forcing them to apply their own critical thinking skills.

                                Due to time constraints, we tested this game with fellow classmates, which made the social element of voting less immersive. Our classmates already knew we were a team, and this significantly limited demon gameplay, where players felt limited because their identity as the demon was known.

                                For our final round of gameplay, we wanted to test our game with representative users. We were able to recruit 6 active users of Facebook using our screener survey from initial exploratory research. We also wanted the game to feel significantly more social. We devised a Wizard of Oz approach to make users feel like they were playing with 4 other strangers and coming together to vote.
                                <br><br>
                                We interviewed two participants at a time – one playing through Ghost Hunter gameplay (P1) and one through Demon gameplay (P2). We started by having P1, P2, and three confederates (C1, C2, C3) from our project team join a Zoom lobby with one of us acting as lead researcher (R1). 
                                <br><br>
                                We then pretended to send all participants and confederates to individual breakout rooms where they would be joined by a researcher to conduct a game flow. In reality, only P1 and P2 were sent to individual breakout rooms. The confederates remained in the lobby.
                                <br><br>
                                After a game flow was completed, P1 and P2 rejoined the lobby, where the confederates were “already waiting”. The five players then discussed and voted, with no researcher supervision, allowing them to be authentic. C1 then initiated a discussion asking players how they felt about the game, and players could be more honest given they didn’t think they were talking to a researcher
                                <br><br>
                                The simulation created a completely immersive experience where players were able to fully enjoy the social experience. Most players thought they were playing a fully working, online version of the game.

                                Our final hi-fi prototype was received incredibly well during playthrough. Players loved the social element of gameplay now that it had been executed correctly, and mentioned that they’d love to play the game with friends. Both Ghost Hunter and Demon gameplay were complimented, although players did find the power-ups and general scheming element of the demon gameplay more enjoyable. Players’ main “complaint” was that the game didn’t have more rounds to play through.

                                We also presented our findings to our classmates and professor, Geoff Kaufman. Geoff is a nationally recognized leader in leveraging embedded design techniques to develop games for social impact, and was able to weigh in on the game’s persuasive design principles. He gave a glowing review, praising the game’s intervention techniques and execution. He also encouraged us to go further by adding in additional gameplay elements to reduce the prominence of news-reading (e.g., mini-games, tasks), and introducing other ways of training critical thinking (e.g., including family members as sources).
                                <br><br>
                                This was an incredibly rewarding project with a rock star group of collaborators. I have two main takeaways going forward. Firstly, leveraging a diverge/converge method for idea generation leads to a far richer final solution than a linear process. By diverging thrice in our project (during initial ideation, then again when developing a game narrative, then again during lo-fi prototypes) our entire team was able to contribute incredible ideas that we brought together for a powerful solution.

                                Designing a game also taught me more about empathy than any other project I’ve been on. Every decision has to actively focus on increasing enjoyability, from copy to visual design elements, to interactions. This forced me to be disciplined and thoughtful in all my decisions, a philosophy I hope to carry forward in future projects.

                                        Some of the strongest elements of your game are its elaborate narrative, the tools it gives the player playing as the Demon (e.g., the ability to send signals by claiming and manipulating news may make role of the deceiver more accessible for players who are intimidated by being the “one” going against the “many”), and its secondary goal of increasing players’ confidence in discussing, and defending their positions on, sources of information.
