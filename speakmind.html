                        <p>
                            COVID-19 has been more than a physical health crisis. Last year, 67% of Canadians said their mental health was good or very good; this year that number has <a href="http://angusreid.org/isolation-and-loneliness-covid19/" target="_blank">dropped to 53%</a>. A huge driver of that is loneliness, which has had a <a href="https://www.morneaushepell.com/sites/default/files/assets/paragraphs/resource-list/mhicanadaseptember2020final.pdf" target="">greater impact on mental health than even the fear of dying from COVID-19</a>. Despite this loneliness, Canadians do not want to talk to mental health professionals <a href="https://www.camh.ca/en/driving-change/addressing-stigma" target="_blank">because of perceived stigma</a>. How can we help this huge portion of the population feel better?
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Solution</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            More than anything, lonely Canadians wanted someone to empathize with their problems and provide relevant perspectives. SpeakMind is a non-profit that seeks to provide just that, connecting lonely Canadians to empathetic listeners without facing any perceived stigma. SpeakMind users just let us know what’s on their mind along with some basic demographic information, and we match them to someone with similar demographics who can understand the user’s current state, and offer helpful advice. 
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="prototype mt-4"><span class="highlightBlue">Outcomes</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            SpeakMind garnered ~400 signups in its first month of inception from both volunteers and users. 100% of SpeakMind users have provided a perfect satisfaction rating with the service, with several users forming ongoing friendships with their listeners. SpeakMind has been featured across various volunteer and news platforms as a result of its value to Canadians, including a feature in <a href="https://www.toronto.com/news-story/9985473-volunteers-in-toronto-are-ready-to-crush-covid-19-isolation-by-phone/ " target="_blank">Toronto.com</a>, Toronto’s largest local news site.

                                    Given that we’re a fledgling company, our website’s main purpose is to provide more information about our mission and services. The vast majority of our interviewees said that they would already be interested in participating in our service if they clicked through to our website, so our home page expedites the sign-up process by providing a concise summary of SpeakMind’s purpose to users and volunteers and funneling them to sign up.
                                    <br><br>
                                    A smaller but vocal minority also came to our website to learn more about us, details on their potential experience with us, and our differentiating factors. To answer these questions, we structured a concise FAQ page where interested visitors can easily find the information, they need with navigation tabs.                                    
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    For lonely Canadians that are looking to find someone to talk to, our user sign-up form allows them to quickly input the essential information we need to connect them to someone that can relate to our users’ issues and provide helpful advice.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The wording of the form is carefully selected to avoid stigmatizing words like “mental health”, “depression”, or “anxiety”, which can deter users from getting support for fear of appearing mentally unstable. To provide full transparency and build trust, we provide rationale for every question we ask. As they go through the form, users buy into our process and are more likely to fill in optional information about themselves that improves our matching process. 
                                    
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    For Canadians that want to help abate their peers’ feelings of loneliness, our volunteer sign-up form collects contact / demographic information, as well as areas of experience that volunteers would be comfortable discussing with users. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Whereas users are seeking help, volunteers are providing it. As a result, our form introduction asks volunteers to sign up if they “think it’s important to stand together in this age”, leveraging principles of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/commitment-consistency-ux/" target="_blank">consistency and commitment</a> to persuade them to follow through on their sign-up. Similarly to the user sign-up form, our form also lays out the rationale for questions to build trust with prospective volunteers.                                    
                                </p>

                                    To set our volunteers up for success, the Volunteer Orientation Package lays out how volunteers can help their matches deal with mental stressors using a variety of tactics promoted by Canada’s leading mental health organizations.

                                    The purpose of this document is two-fold – make our volunteers feel comfortable, and make sure they always act appropriately. We interviewed various volunteers to understand their hesitations in helping their matches and addressed those hesitations in our guide (e.g., laying out what they are and aren’t expected to do). We also worked with various mental health professionals across Canada to make sure our advice was sound and provided guidance at various levels of situation escalation.

                            <strong>Understand where our solution may be lacking: </strong>
                            All the UX research work I did for this project was leveraged in preparation for SpeakMind’s launch. Unfortunately, I was unable to interview or survey SpeakMind’s users after launch, which would have helped me understand how our offering could be improved to better support our users.                            
                        <p>
                            <strong>Learn why volunteer sign-ups outpaced user sign-ups: </strong>
                            Despite avoiding stigmatizing words in our copy and emphasizing how users would be matched with “people like them”, volunteer sign-ups were over triple user sign-ups. I’d love to dive into why this disparity exists, and if tweaks in the presentation of our solution could close this gap.                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Consolidate best practices across volunteers:</strong>
                            Some of our volunteers had extremely glowing reviews from their matches. I’d love to interview these rock stars to learn the approaches they took to support their users, with the hope of standardizing those approaches across our volunteer base.

                            <strong>Explore more outside-the-box solutions: </strong>
                            Early on in the research process, I became fixated on a solution that retained many of traditional helplines’ dynamics (talking to a stranger on the phone for support). This fixation eventually birthed SpeakMind. I wish I explored more diverse concepts early on – why does the best solution have to resemble a helpline?                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Expand my visual design skills: </strong>
                            I focused most of my efforts on understanding users’ and volunteers’ needs on this project, but there were ample opportunities to improve my visual design skills (e.g., Instagram ads) that I wish I had capitalized on beyond making them “good enough”                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Provide more support to volunteers early on: </strong>
                            Early on in SpeakMind’s launch, volunteers only had the orientation package to guide them in their conversations with users, which left some volunteers still feeling uncertain on how to start conversations. Eventually, I developed an email guide on starting conversations, but I wish I had provided that support earlier.

                            <strong>Designing for multiple stakeholder groups: </strong>
                            This was my first UX research project designing for multiple user archetypes (users and volunteers). Although the complexity of balancing both parties’ interests was initially taxing, by incorporating both parties’ views, I designed a solution that better served everyone                            
                        </p>

                            <strong>Incorporating user perspectives in my writing: </strong>
                            I’ve traditionally spent most of my time in concept development fleshing out the mechanics and features of solutions, worrying less about elements like copy. With the sensitive topics I dealt with in this project, I became far more appreciative of the role of UX in designing a strong experience                            
                        </p>

                            <strong>Manually A/B testing my work to optimize it: </strong>
                            I used an A/B approach to test various emails and optimize my approach across dozens of outreach initiatives. I learned how to quickly and effectively parse meaningful differences between options to extract the best features of all my versions.

                                COVID-19 unleashed an unprecedented physical health crisis on the world in 2020. However, as public gatherings shut down and social isolation became the norm, the pandemic also triggered another, lesser known, mental health crisis. 
                                <br><br>
                                In Canada, mental health took a nosedive. 23% of Canadians suffered from isolated and lonely in 2019; <a href="http://angusreid.org/isolation-and-loneliness-covid19/" target="_blank">that number was 33% in 2020</a>. Morneau Shepell reports Canadians’ average mental health score on a monthly basis and reported that the lowest average mental health score was observed amongst respondents reporting feelings of loneliness during COVID-19. Their mental health score was <a href="https://www.morneaushepell.com/sites/default/files/assets/paragraphs/resource-list/mhicanadaseptember2020final.pdf" target="_blank">1.5x worse than those who feared dying from COVID-19</a>. 
                                <br><br>
                                As someone living in Toronto, Canada during this time and seeing the impact of COVID on the mental health of my loved ones, solving this issue was personal for me. After receiving work from home mandates at my firm, many of my colleagues who had immigrated to Toronto without friends and family became withdrawn and frequently complained about loneliness. I hated seeing them suffer with no obvious solution in sight. How could I help them feel less lonely while respecting rules around social isolation?

                                Before I could tackle this issue and begin interviewing disproportionately impacted Canadians, I wanted to better understand how to define this subset of the population. I dove into the literature discussing the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. 
                                <br><br>
                                Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 was magnifying loneliness in populations that were already particularly susceptible. That primarily included 18 – 30 year olds and people facing unemployment or students, along with people that lived alone. People living in urban centers were also disproportionately impacted.
                                <br><br>
                                These findings helped me narrow down the people I wanted to talk to and learn more from. Many of these factors applied to my work colleagues – younger people living alone in downtown Toronto. Others applied to some of my casual friends that were still in school. These populations became the focus of my user interviews.

                                understood that getting respondents to reflect openly about these factors would be difficult. To motivate honest thinking and avoid interviewees romanticizing or misremembering their experiences before COVID, I constructed a contextual inquiry protocol.
                                <br><br>
                                I understood that I couldn’t observe users in the context of a time before COVID, so I instead had them bring an artifact that reminded them of a day before COVID where they felt socially fulfilled. I asked them to screenshot their calendar on a day they felt happy, where there were no extraordinary social engagements that would be impossible to reproduce.
                                <br><br>
                                Users brought packed calendars – days filled with full days of meetings or brainstorming sessions. They talked about how those meetings provided opportunities to share moments from their days and talk casually with people that were willing to listen. 
                                <br><br>
                                These users were describing relatively inconsequential social interaction that took on new meaning and importance because it allowed them to take their lives less seriously and stress less about small inconveniences (e.g., complaining about a boss or professor together), something they realized they did a lot more now.

                                Upon synthesizing these findings, I wondered why users neglected free helplines or warmlines if they were just looking for someone to chat with. These services were designed for people feeling lonely or anxious (as opposed to crisis lines for those posing a threat to their own lives).
                                <br><br>
                                To answer my question, I had users try out one such warmline with a think-aloud protocol where they went through the service’s chat feature and talked about the service’s value to them. 
                                <br><br>
                                 The warmline was received poorly. Users that claimed they wanted a chance to casually chat about their day and frustrations felt that they were admitting they had mental health issues by participating in something so “formal”. The chat felt far too mechanical and inaccessible to them – they’d prefer to text or hop on a call to mimic actual social interaction. 
                                <br><br>
                                However, the overarching feedback across all 8 interviews was that they had nothing in common with their support worker. The worker didn’t understand their life, circumstances, or experiences. They imagined somebody old and out of touch (workers’ identities are anonymous), when users wanted somebody who could relate to them and share their frustrations instead of trying to be consoling.

                                Our team’s renewed goal was to find a way to connect our target users to “people like them”. At the same time, our team wanted to be mindful of physical distancing mandates and develop a virtual solution. How could we do this?
                                <br><br>
                                To explore possibilities, we brainstormed in the form of storyboards. Unfortunately, our team had become enamored by the idea of an improved hotline system, and it made it difficult for us to expand our thinking far beyond this structure. Ultimately, we fleshed out three distinct ideas:
                                <br><br>
                                <ol>

                                <li><strong>Echo Chamber: </strong>Users facing a life annoyance can post about it on a forum, where someone facing a similar annoyance can reply to strike up a conversation</li>
                                <li><strong>SpeakMind: </strong>Users can submit their contact information and issue to an anonymous service that matches them with someone like them that is happy to lend an empathetic ear</li>
                                </ol>
                                Before narrowing down on a single solution, we wanted to get our target users’ perspectives on which concept resonated most with them.

                                After going through our storyboards, our interviewees strongly gravitated towards <i>SpeakMind</i>. They felt it remedied a lot of the issues present in the warmline. They were matched with someone as opposed to being randomly assigned, which made them feel more connected to the person they were talking to. Additionally, because volunteers were regular people, interviewees imagined the conversations being more organic, as opposed to feeling therapeutic or structured.
                                <br><br>
                                Although interviewees liked SpeakMind’s lack of structure, they thought <i>Game On!</i> took it too far. They worried that users of the service would be more focused on gaming than conversation, and that any attempts they made to talk about their lives would be poorly received. Despite the warmline’s unwanted formality, users still wanted the purpose of the service to be clear to all.
                                <br><br>
                                Echo Chamber was received more positively. Users enjoyed being able to express their complaints and find likeminded peers to share annoyances with. However, interviewees also disliked how the service’s sole focus was on complaints. Common issues should be a contributing factor to matches, but not the sole factor. 
                                <br><br>
                                With so many considerations and preferences to keep track of, I developed a user persona to ensure that our future designs could incorporate all of our target user’s feedback to date.

                                Although users responded positively to the concept of SpeakMind, we also wanted to understand what potential issues there could be in the end-to-end experience. 
                                <br><br>
                                We began by developing a user journey map, including all the information we had to date on the customer’s desired experience. Although we hadn’t spoken to our users about how they imagined discovering a service like SpeakMind, we were able to talk with <a href="https://www.getgroceryhero.com/" target="_blank">another COVID-specific non-profit</a> and learn that most users (particularly within our persona’s age range) learned about the service through Instagram ads.
                                <br><br>
                                We then translated this journey map into a low-fidelity prototype. By keeping fidelity low, we wanted users to focus on the core parts of the experience, and worry less about superficial elements like color choices. 
                                <br><br>
                                The prototype covered the end-to-end experience of SpeakMind, starting with discovery through an Instagram ad, click through to our website, sign up through a form, contact and discussion with a match, then feedback. We were able to run through this entire experience with our participants over Zoom. To simulate the “discussion with a match”, a member of our team was given the participant’s number and called them after the signup process was complete.

                                Our “digital paper prototype” received mixed reviews. Users still liked the core idea of being matched to a person like them, and many actually had 20-30 minute conversations with our volunteer stand-in. However, users also felt that our prototype kept making it “hard to get on board”.

                                The relatively barren homepage, with only a brief description and sign up buttons, felt sketchy to them. Users wondered how they would have any potential concerns or questions addressed, especially when so little information was provided. To them, transparency was especially important for a mental health solution.
                                <br><br>
                                The sign-up process was also abrasive. Users felt there were too many personal questions (we had posed them to better match users to “people like them”) and thought that focusing on users’ demographics and issues would be sufficient. 
                                <br><br>
                                Users also hated our usage of “mental health” language. Our reference to terms like anxiety, depression, mental health surfaced feelings of judgment and insecurity once again. Our simulated volunteer also started conversations by asking “what was wrong”, which put users on edge when they were just seeking a normal conversation. We realized we needed to put more attention on the volunteer experience and put them in a position to succeed. As of now, after they were matched with users, volunteers were being left to their own devices.

                                As we moved to high-fidelity, I started by rewriting all our copy. I avoided stigmatizing terminology, and instead focused on identifying our target users as those feeling “stressed”, “bored”, or “lonely”. 
                                <br><br>
                                In the spirit of transparency and openness, we also developed a contact page for users to ask questions, and began work on an FAQ page to answer some of the major questions that had come up across our various interviews. We added rationale descriptions below each of our survey questions to put our users at ease and address data privacy concerns that had come up.
                                <br><br>
                                We also overhauled the structure of the user sign-up form. We removed the more invasive personal questions, asking only about users’ demographics and issue. We even made these personal questions optional, so all users had to tell us was their contact information and age. 
                                <br><br>
                                After testing this updated version of the website with the users, we were met with resounding approval. But our interviews had revealed a gaping hole in our process – we had done nothing to improve the volunteer experience. We switched gears to building that experience out.

                                Designing for a smooth volunteer experience felt like going back to square one. 
                                Thankfully, this was a rare case where we understood the volunteer journey relatively well – it would be dictated by the user journey. We fleshed it out in another user journey map to ensure we weren’t missing elements of the volunteer experience, then designed the artifacts needed for another round of testing.

                                This included developing the volunteer sign-up form, building out the FAQ page to include volunteer-specific questions, and designing email templates instructing volunteers how to contact their matches.
                                <br><br>
                                We structured testing similarly to our user experience prototyping – starting with discovery through to chatting with a “user” that one of us posed as. Interviewees were generally complimentary, but noted throughout the process that they felt “in over their head”. 
                                <br><br>
                                They were terrified of saying the wrong thing to users or worsening their state, and felt that SpeakMind just wasn’t doing enough to support them. Our current process was too clinical and hands-off – we needed to provide guidance to volunteers on how to interact with their matches.

                                From our interviews, volunteers’ feelings of inadequacy and worry became most prominent right after being matched. In that moment, when users stated their issues, volunteers felt completely unprepared to help, and talked about quitting entirely. How do we empower our volunteers?
                                <br><br>
                                We developed a multi-pronged support system that provided guidance to volunteers at every step of the way after sign-up. Immediately after being accepted to SpeakMind, volunteers would receive an orientation package detailing what their role did and didn’t entail, general and specific tactics to tackle loneliness, and what to do if their match needed the help of a professional. We made expectations clear and showed our volunteers how to excel within their role.
                                <br><br>
                                Because this package required significant volunteer and medical professional input beyond our own understanding, we took a collaborative, rapid-iteration approach. We scheduled twice-daily meetings with at least one prospective volunteer or medical professional, got their feedback on the package, then improved it for the next meeting. In the span of a week, we went from a rough skeleton to a completed package that empowered volunteers and contained medically sound recommendations.

                                With our offering fully developed, I wondered if I could take a design-centered approach to outreach as well. I elected to try A/B testing as an efficient way to try out different email permutations, especially because I knew the exact goal I was trying to optimize for: response rate.
                                <br><br>
                                I crafted 5 different versions of emails to send out. Each had <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-is-the-most-important-part-of-an-email/" target="_blank">drastically different subject lines</a> ranging from playful (Let’s solve Canada’s loneliness pandemic together) to more cryptic (We can help you boost your impact on Toronto’s mental wellness). Over dozens of sendouts and varying reply rates, I was able to parse out the elements that both drove and prevented action by examining elements of overlap between emails that did well or poorly.
                                <br><br>
                                Eventually, we settled on our final subject line which incorporated the best elements of our options. With this subject line, we were published in a news article, featured on various volunteer organization sites, and hosted on various company volunteer sites (including Manulife).

                                Within the first month of SpeakMind’s launch in May, we received ~400 signups from volunteers and users. Thanks to a diverse pool of volunteers, we were able to match all our users with volunteers that had similar experiences and demographics to facilitate rewarding conversations. Users that completed feedback forms after their SpeakMind experience ended provided a 100% satisfaction rate, with many continuing to stay in touch with their volunteer outside of SpeakMind. 
                                <br><br>
                                Many of our volunteers also provided glowing reviews, citing how well-structured the organization was, and how rewarding the experience had been. We were able to overcome the overwhelming hesitation volunteers had felt earlier on in our development process. SpeakMind also garnered attention in the local press, featured in one of Toronto’s most-read local newspapers.

                                For me, starting up my own non-profit with design-centered principles was an incredible learning experience. I loved the opportunity to operate autonomously and use my UX research toolkit to define SpeakMind’s value proposition and strategy.

                                I also loved being able to make a difference for my community and design for a neglected group of people in our society. I hope my future design work will allow me to positively impact the lives of broad populations, and bring people closer together.

                                        Hello, it is almost the end of the summer and things have now settled down into some new semblance of normalcy so I thought I should update you on what has been happening. First, my initial match actually introduced me to one of his friends because he was feeling stressed over summer school. So ever since mid July I have been regularly interacting with 2 people thanks to speakmind! I am actually very grateful that my initial match thought of doing this because it is very flattering to be given another opportunity. It just feels very good to know that you are adding value and other people find you helpful, especially in times like these.
